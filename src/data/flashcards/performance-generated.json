Expand call stacks to find culprit code.\n5. **Investigate `Core Animation`:** If scrolling *looks* slow but CPU usage is low, check `Core Animation`.  Highlight flashes may indicate excessive drawing or layout.\n6. **Allocations:**  Excessive object allocations/deallocations during scroll degrade perf.\n7. **Example:**  If `cellForRowAt` shows high CPU, check for image decoding on the main thread.  Move it to a background queue (GCD, `Operation`) and cache results.",

      "back": "Common techniques include: 1) Using value types (structs, enums) where appropriate to avoid unnecessary reference counting. 2) Avoiding strong reference cycles using `weak` and `unowned`. 3) Using `autoreleasepool` for large, temporary object allocations. 4) Optimizing image loading using `URLCache` or framework like Kingfisher. 5) Efficient data structures (e.g., using `Set` instead of `Array` for membership checks). Benefits: Reduced memory footprint, fewer crashes, faster app launch, and improved UI responsiveness.",

Batch requests when possible to reduce round trips. Utilize `NSPredicate` for filtering to retrieve only necessary data.
