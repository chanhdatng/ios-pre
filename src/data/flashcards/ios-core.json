      "back": "The UIViewController lifecycle defines the sequence of events that occur from the moment a view controller is initialized until it's deallocated. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for managing resources, updating the UI, and handling data.\n\n**Key Lifecycle Methods:**\n\n*   `init(coder:)`/`init(nibName:bundle:)`:  Initializers. `init(coder:)` is used when a view controller is loaded from a storyboard or xib, while `init(nibName:bundle:)` is used when explicitly loading from a nib file. Override these to perform custom initialization. *Pitfall*: Always call `super.init`.\n*   `loadView()`:  Responsible for creating the view the controller manages. *Pitfall*: Do *not* call `super.loadView()` unless you know what you're doing. Typically, you'll create a view and assign it to `self.view`. Rarely overridden; prefer using storyboards or xibs.\n*   `viewDidLoad()`: Called after the view has been loaded into memory.  Ideal for initial setup, data loading, and configuring subviews. Guaranteed to be called only once. *Pitfall*: Avoid heavy computations here, as it can delay the initial display.\n*   `viewWillAppear(_ animated:)`: Called right before the view is added to the view hierarchy.  Use this to prepare the view for display, like updating data or starting animations. *Pitfall*: Don't perform long-running tasks that block the UI thread.\n*   `viewDidAppear(_ animated:)`: Called after the view has been fully presented on the screen.  Good for starting animations that require the view to be visible or for tracking view appearance. *Pitfall*: Avoid allocating large resources here if they're not immediately needed.\n*   `viewWillDisappear(_ animated:)`: Called right before the view is removed from the view hierarchy.  Use this to save data, stop animations, or clean up resources. *Pitfall*: Make sure to properly handle any ongoing operations to prevent unexpected behavior.\n*   `viewDidDisappear(_ animated:)`: Called after the view has been completely removed from the screen.  Ideal for releasing resources or stopping network requests. *Pitfall*: Don't assume the view controller will be deallocated immediately after this method is called.\n*   `deinit`: Called before the view controller is deallocated.  Use this to release any strong references to avoid memory leaks. *Pitfall*: Remove observers and invalidate timers here.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```swift\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        // Set up initial UI elements\n        view.backgroundColor = .white\n        let label = UILabel(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 50))\n        label.center = view.center\n        label.textAlignment = .center\n        label.text = \"Hello, World!\"\n        view.addSubview(label)\n    }\n\n    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n        super.viewWillAppear(animated)\n        // Start animations, update data\n        print(\"View will appear\")\n    }\n\n    override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {\n        super.viewDidDisappear(animated)\n        // Release resources\n        print(\"View did disappear\")\n    }\n\n    deinit {\n        print(\"MyViewController deinitialized\")\n        // Remove observers, invalidate timers\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n\n*   **Forgetting to call `super`:**  Always call `super` in overridden methods to ensure the default behavior is executed.\n*   **Performing heavy tasks on the main thread:** Avoid blocking the UI thread with long-running operations.\n*   **Memory leaks:**  Release strong references in `deinit` to prevent memory leaks.\n*   **Incorrect resource management:**  Allocate and release resources at the appropriate lifecycle stages.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n\n*   **MVVM/VIPER:**  Consider using architectural patterns like MVVM or VIPER to separate concerns and reduce the complexity of view controllers.\n*   **Combine/RxSwift:** Use reactive frameworks to handle asynchronous operations and data updates in a more declarative way.\n\nOverriding lifecycle methods allows fine-grained control over a view controller's behavior, but it's important to understand the purpose of each method and avoid common pitfalls to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.",

      "back": "Programmatic Auto Layout offers precise control over UI. Core concept: constraints define relationships between views (position, size). \n\n**Explanation:**\nWe use `NSLayoutConstraint` to define rules. `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false` is crucial; UIKit's legacy system interferes otherwise. Constraints are then activated.\n\n**Code Example:**\n```swift\nlet myView = UIView()\nmyView.backgroundColor = .red\nmyView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false // Disable autoresizing mask translation\nview.addSubview(myView)\n\nNSLayoutConstraint.activate([\n myView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 100),\n myView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 100),\n myView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),\n myView.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor)\n])\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n1. **Forgetting `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints`:**  Leads to conflicts, unpredictable behavior. Views will try to manage their own layout based on frame.\n2. **Constraint Conflicts:**  Overlapping/contradictory rules cause runtime errors. Use debug console to identify conflicts.\n3. **Insufficient Constraints:**  Views need enough constraints to fully define their position and size.  Ambiguous layouts result.\n4. **Incorrect Anchors:**  Using incorrect view anchors when creating constraints (e.g., using `topAnchor` when `bottomAnchor` is needed).\n5. **Priority Issues:** Understand constraint priorities. Use `constraint.priority = .defaultHigh` to allow some constraints to be broken if necessary.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n*   **Activation:** Always activate constraints using `NSLayoutConstraint.activate([constraint1, constraint2])`. This is more efficient than activating individually.\n*   **Readability:** Create constraints within functions or computed properties for better organization.\n*   **Debugging:** Use Xcode's visual debugger and constraint solver logs to diagnose issues.\n*   **Custom Views:** When creating custom views, define constraints within the `init` methods or `updateConstraints` method.\n*   **Safe Area:** Use `safeAreaLayoutGuide` for views that need to respect the safe area insets.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n*   **Interface Builder (Storyboards/XIBs):** Visually design layouts. Good for simple UIs, but less flexible for dynamic layouts.\n*   **SwiftUI:** Declarative UI framework.  Uses a different approach to layout (stacks, grids, etc.).  Consider for new projects.\n*   **Third-party libraries (e.g., SnapKit, Cartography):** Provide a more concise syntax for creating constraints. Can improve code readability, but adds a dependency.\n\n**When to Use Programmatic Auto Layout:**\n*   Dynamic layouts that change based on data or user interaction.\n*   Custom views with complex layout requirements.\n*   Situations where Interface Builder becomes too cumbersome or difficult to manage.\n*   When creating reusable UI components or libraries.",

      "back": "Compositional layouts in UICollectionView, introduced in iOS 13, offer a more flexible and powerful way to define the visual structure of a collection view compared to the traditional flow layout.  Instead of a linear arrangement, compositional layouts allow you to create complex, nested layouts using `NSCollectionLayoutSection` and `NSCollectionLayoutGroup`. \n\n**Core Concepts:**\n*   `NSCollectionLayoutSize`: Defines the size of items, groups, and sections. Can be absolute, fractional (relative to the container), or estimated.\n*   `NSCollectionLayoutItem`: Represents a single item in the collection view.\n*   `NSCollectionLayoutGroup`: A container for items, arranged horizontally, vertically, or customly. Groups can be nested.\n*   `NSCollectionLayoutSection`: A container for groups, defining the overall layout of a section.  Includes properties for scrolling behavior, content insets, and boundary supplementary items (headers/footers).\n*   `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout`: The layout object responsible for arranging the collection view's content based on the defined sections.\n\n**Difference from Flow Layout:**\nFlow layouts are simpler, arranging items in a grid-like fashion, flowing to the next line or column when the current one is full. Compositional layouts provide much more control, allowing for custom arrangements, variable item sizes within a group, and nested groups for complex layouts.\n\n**Code Example:**\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n\nclass ViewController: UIViewController, UICollectionViewDataSource, UICollectionViewDelegate {\n\n    private var collectionView: UICollectionView!\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        \n        // 1. Create the compositional layout\n        let layout = UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout {\n            (sectionIndex: Int, layoutEnvironment: NSCollectionLayoutEnvironment) -> NSCollectionLayoutSection? in\n            \n            // 2. Define the item size\n            let itemSize = NSCollectionLayoutSize(\n                widthDimension: .fractionalWidth(1.0),\n                heightDimension: .fractionalHeight(1.0))\n            let item = NSCollectionLayoutItem(layoutSize: itemSize)\n            item.contentInsets = NSDirectionalEdgeInsets(top: 5, leading: 5, bottom: 5, trailing: 5)\n\n            // 3. Define the group size\n            let groupSize = NSCollectionLayoutSize(\n                widthDimension: .fractionalWidth(1.0),\n                heightDimension: .absolute(50))\n            let group = NSCollectionLayoutGroup.horizontal(layoutSize: groupSize, subitems: [item])\n\n            // 4. Define the section\n            let section = NSCollectionLayoutSection(group: group)\n            section.contentInsets = NSDirectionalEdgeInsets(top: 10, leading: 10, bottom: 10, trailing: 10)\n            return section\n        }\n\n        // 5. Initialize the collection view\n        collectionView = UICollectionView(frame: view.bounds, collectionViewLayout: layout)\n        collectionView.dataSource = self\n        collectionView.delegate = self\n        collectionView.register(UICollectionViewCell.self, forCellWithReuseIdentifier: \"cell\")\n        collectionView.backgroundColor = .white\n        view.addSubview(collectionView)\n        collectionView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([\n            collectionView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor),\n            collectionView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor),\n            collectionView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),\n            collectionView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor)\n        ])\n    }\n\n    func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -> Int {\n        return 20\n    }\n\n    func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {\n        let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: \"cell\", for: indexPath)\n        cell.backgroundColor = .lightGray\n        return cell\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n*   Incorrectly calculating sizes:  Fractional sizes can be tricky; ensure they add up correctly within their container.\n*   Forgetting content insets:  Items can appear cramped if you don't consider insets.\n*   Performance issues: Complex layouts with many items can impact performance.  Use estimated sizes and prefetching to optimize.\n\n**When to Use vs Alternatives:**\n*   Use compositional layouts when you need highly customized and dynamic layouts that are difficult or impossible to achieve with flow layouts.\n*   Alternatives include using flow layouts for simple grids, or custom layouts by subclassing `UICollectionViewLayout` for extremely specific needs.  However, compositional layouts generally provide the best balance of flexibility and ease of use for most complex scenarios.  Consider the complexity of your desired layout when choosing the appropriate approach.",

      "back": "Diffable data sources (introduced in iOS 13, Swift 5.1+) revolutionize `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` updates by adopting a declarative approach. Instead of manually calculating and applying index path changes, you define the desired state (a new snapshot) and let the data source handle the transition.\n\n*Core Concept:* Diffable data sources use the `NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot` to represent the data's state. You create snapshots representing the current and new data, and the data source automatically computes the minimal set of changes (insertions, deletions, moves, and updates) to update the view.\n\n*Code Example:* \n```swift\nenum Section {\n  case main\n}\n\nstruct Item: Hashable {\n  let id = UUID()\n  let title: String\n}\n\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate {\n  @IBOutlet var tableView: UITableView!\n  \n  private var dataSource: UITableViewDiffableDataSource<Section, Item>!\n  private var items: [Item] = []\n\n  override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    items = [Item(title: \"Item 1\"), Item(title: \"Item 2\")]\n\n    dataSource = UITableViewDiffableDataSource<Section, Item>(tableView: tableView) {\n      (tableView, indexPath, item) -> UITableViewCell? in\n      let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: \"Cell\", for: indexPath)\n      cell.textLabel?.text = item.title\n      return cell\n    }\n    tableView.delegate = self\n    applyInitialSnapshot()\n  }\n\n  func applyInitialSnapshot() {\n    var snapshot = NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot<Section, Item>()\n    snapshot.appendSections([.main])\n    snapshot.appendItems(items)\n    dataSource.apply(snapshot, animatingDifferences: true)\n  }\n  \n  func addItem() {\n    items.append(Item(title: \"New Item\"))\n    var snapshot = NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot<Section, Item>()\n    snapshot.appendSections([.main])\n    snapshot.appendItems(items)\n    dataSource.apply(snapshot, animatingDifferences: true)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*Improvements over older approaches (e.g., `beginUpdates`/`endUpdates`):*\n- *Safety:* Reduces the risk of inconsistent UI state due to incorrect index path calculations.\n- *Performance:* Optimized diffing algorithm for efficient updates.\n- *Readability:* Declarative style simplifies update logic.\n- *Animation handling:* Built-in support for animated updates.\n\n*Common Pitfalls/Edge Cases:*\n- *Hashable conformance:*  Items in the data source *must* conform to the `Hashable` protocol for the diffing algorithm to work correctly.  Ensure your `hash(into:)` method and `==` operator are implemented properly.  Incorrect implementations will lead to unexpected behavior.\n- *Data mutations:*  Modifying items *after* they've been added to the snapshot without creating a new snapshot will *not* update the UI. Snapshots capture the *state* of the data at a specific point in time.\n- *Large datasets:* While generally efficient, very large datasets might require optimization to avoid performance bottlenecks during snapshot creation and diffing.\n- *Reloading Data:* Avoid calling `reloadData()` when using diffable data sources.  It defeats the purpose and negates the performance benefits.\n- *Supplementary Views/Cells:* Remember to configure supplementary views (e.g., header/footer views) and cells using the `dataSource.supplementaryViewProvider` property.\n\n*When to use vs. Alternatives:*\n- *Use Diffable Data Sources:* For most `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` scenarios, especially when dealing with dynamic data and frequent updates. They are the preferred approach for new projects.\n- *Alternatives (Legacy):*\n  - `beginUpdates`/`endUpdates`:  Use only for very simple, localized updates or when maintaining older codebases.  They are generally more error-prone.\n  - Third-party libraries: Some libraries offer similar functionality, but diffable data sources are the standard, Apple-provided solution.\n\nDiffable data sources promote cleaner, safer, and more efficient UI updates in table and collection views.

      "back": "UIKit and SwiftUI interop is crucial for leveraging existing code or specific platform features. Two main mechanisms exist: `UIViewControllerRepresentable` and `UIViewRepresentable` for using UIKit in SwiftUI, and `UIHostingController` for using SwiftUI in UIKit.\n\n`UIViewControllerRepresentable` and `UIViewRepresentable` allow you to wrap UIKit views/controllers for use in SwiftUI.  They require implementing `makeUIViewController(context:)`/`makeUIView(context:)` to create the UIKit component and `updateUIViewController(_:context:)`/`updateUIView(_:context:)` to handle updates.\n\nExample:\n```swift\nstruct MyMapView: UIViewRepresentable {\n    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> MKMapView {\n        MKMapView()\n    }\n\n    func updateUIView(_ uiView: MKMapView, context: Context) {\n        // Update the map view, e.g., setting annotations\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`UIHostingController` hosts a SwiftUI view within a UIKit context. Instantiate it with the SwiftUI view as the root view.\n\nExample:\n```swift\nlet swiftUIView = MySwiftUIView()\nlet hostingController = UIHostingController(rootView: swiftUIView)\nnavigationController?.pushViewController(hostingController, animated: true)\n```\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n*   **Lifecycle management:** UIKit and SwiftUI have different lifecycles. Ensure proper synchronization when passing data or reacting to events.\n*   **Performance:** Excessive interop can impact performance. Minimize unnecessary updates and consider using Combine or delegation for efficient communication.\n*   **Layout:** UIKit's Auto Layout and SwiftUI's layout system can conflict. Use constraints and `setContentHuggingPriority`/`setContentCompressionResistancePriority` carefully.\n*   **Data flow:** Managing data flow between the two worlds requires careful consideration. Using `@Binding` with coordinators can help.\n\nWhen to use which:\n*   Use `*Representable` when you need to embed a UIKit view/controller into a SwiftUI view hierarchy.\n*   Use `UIHostingController` when you want to display a SwiftUI view within a UIKit-based app.\n\nAlternatives:\n*   Refactoring UIKit code to SwiftUI (ideal long-term, but costly).\n*   Using a hybrid approach where core logic is framework-agnostic, and UI is implemented separately in UIKit and SwiftUI.",

      "front": "Explain custom view controller transitions in UIKit. How do you implement interactive transitions? What are some common pitfalls?",
      "back": "Custom view controller transitions allow you to define how one view controller is presented or dismissed. Instead of using the default slide or fade, you create unique, engaging animations. \n\nConcept: Implementing custom transitions involves adopting `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` in the presenting view controller. This delegate provides objects that handle the presentation and dismissal animations.  These objects conform to `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` for animations, and `UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning` for interactive control.\n\nExample:\n```swift\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate {\n  let transition = MyCustomTransition()\n\n  override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {\n    let destination = segue.destination\n    destination.transitioningDelegate = self\n    destination.modalPresentationStyle = .custom // or .fullScreen\n  }\n\n  func animationController(forPresentedController presented: UIViewController, presenting: UIViewController, sourceController source: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {\n    transition.isPresenting = true\n    return transition\n  }\n\n  func animationController(forDismissedController dismissed: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {\n    transition.isPresenting = false\n    return transition\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyCustomTransition: NSObject, UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning {\n  var isPresenting = false\n\n  func transitionDuration(using transitionContext: UIViewControllerContextTransitioning?) -> TimeInterval {\n    return 0.5\n  }\n\n  func animateTransition(using transitionContext: UIViewControllerContextTransitioning) {\n    guard let toVC = transitionContext.viewController(forKey: .to),\n          let fromVC = transitionContext.viewController(forKey: .from)\n    else { return }\n\n    let containerView = transitionContext.containerView\n\n    if isPresenting {\n      containerView.addSubview(toVC.view)\n      toVC.view.alpha = 0\n      UIView.animate(withDuration: transitionDuration(using: transitionContext), animations: {\n        toVC.view.alpha = 1\n      }, completion: { _ in\n        transitionContext.completeTransition(!transitionContext.transitionWasCancelled)\n      })\n    } else {\n      UIView.animate(withDuration: transitionDuration(using: transitionContext), animations: {\n        fromVC.view.alpha = 0\n      }, completion: { _ in\n        transitionContext.completeTransition(!transitionContext.transitionWasCancelled)\n        fromVC.view.removeFromSuperview()\n      })\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nInteractive Transitions: Implement `UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning` along with a gesture recognizer (e.g., `UIPanGestureRecognizer`).  Update the transition's progress based on the gesture's state using `updateInteractiveTransition(_:)`. Complete or cancel the transition based on the gesture's final state with `finishInteractiveTransition()` or `cancelInteractiveTransition()`.\n\nCommon Pitfalls:\n*   Forgetting to set `modalPresentationStyle` to `.custom` or `.fullScreen`. Otherwise, the transition delegate might not be called.\n*   Incorrectly calculating the transition duration. Ensure it aligns with animation complexity.\n*   Not handling the `transitionWasCancelled` state correctly in `animateTransition(using:)`.  Cleanup is crucial.\n*   Not adding the `toView` to the `containerView` during presentation.\n*   Conflicting gesture recognizers. Ensure gesture recognizers don't interfere with existing UI interactions.\n*   For interactive transitions, properly managing the transition context and updating the progress based on user input. Ensure proper cancellation and completion.\n\nAlternatives:\n*   Using built-in presentation styles (e.g., `UIModalPresentationStyle.formSheet`).\n*   Using UIKit Dynamics for physics-based animations (although less common for full view controller transitions).\n*   View animations for simpler transitions within a single view controller.\n\nUse custom transitions when you need fine-grained control over the animation and want to create a unique user experience. Consider the complexity and maintainability before opting for custom transitions over simpler alternatives.",

If the first responder doesn't handle the event, it's passed up the chain to the next responder.\n\nThe chain typically progresses from the view to its superview, then to the view controller, the view controller's parent view controller, the window, the app delegate. Each responder has the opportunity to handle the event or pass it along.  \n\n*Example:* Suppose you have a custom button inside a view. If the button isn't enabled or doesn't handle a touch, the touch event might be passed to the containing view or even the view controller.\n\n*Code Example:* To customize the responder chain, you can override `next` in a `UIResponder` subclass:\n\n```swift\nclass CustomView: UIView {\n    override var next: UIResponder? {\n        // Route events directly to the view controller\n        return self.viewController\n    }\n\n    var viewController: UIViewController? {\n        var responder: UIResponder? = self\n        while responder != nil {\n            if responder is UIViewController {\n                return responder as? UIViewController\n            }\n            responder = responder?.next\n        }\n        return nil\n    }\n\n    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {\n        print(\"Touch began in CustomView\")\n        super.touchesBegan(touches, with: event) // Pass event up the chain if needed\n    }\n}\n```\n\n*Pitfalls:* A common mistake is not calling `super`'s implementation of event handling methods (`touchesBegan`, etc.). This prevents the event from propagating up the chain if the current responder doesn't fully handle it. Another pitfall is creating circular dependencies in the `next` responder, which can lead to infinite loops.\n\n*Alternatives:*  While you can directly manipulate the responder chain, often delegation or target-action are better solutions for handling events, especially for UI interactions.  Delegation provides a clear contract between objects, while target-action provides a flexible way to connect UI elements to actions.  Directly manipulating the responder chain should be reserved for cases where you need to intercept or redirect events in a more fundamental way, such as creating custom input views or handling system-level events.",

      "front": "When creating Auto Layout constraints programmatically, what are the critical steps and common pitfalls a senior developer must avoid to ensure a robust and performant UI? Contrast the modern NSLayoutAnchor API with its predecessor.",
      "back": "Programmatic Auto Layout offers maximum control and avoids Interface Builder's merge conflicts. The process involves three key stages:\n\n1.  **Instantiation & Hierarchy:** Add the view to its superview.\n2.  **Disabling Autoresizing Mask:** Set `view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false`. This is crucial; without it, the system creates conflicting constraints from the view's frame, leading to runtime errors.\n3.  **Constraint Creation & Activation:** Define constraints using the modern, type-safe `NSLayoutAnchor` API. This is preferred over the legacy `NSLayoutConstraint` initializer because it prevents invalid constraints at compile time (e.g., constraining a horizontal anchor to a vertical one). For performance, always activate constraints in a batch using `NSLayoutConstraint.activate([...])` to trigger a single layout pass.\n\n**Code Example:**\n```swift\n// In a UIViewController or UIView subclass\nprivate func setupViews() {\n    let subview = UIView()\n    subview.backgroundColor = .systemBlue\n    // CRITICAL: Disable autoresizing mask translation\n    subview.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n    view.addSubview(subview)\n\n    // Create constraints using the NSLayoutAnchor API\n    let constraints = [\n        subview.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),\n        subview.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor),\n        subview.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 100),\n        subview.heightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: subview.widthAnchor, multiplier: 1.0) // 1:1 aspect ratio\n    ]\n\n    // CRITICAL: Activate constraints in a batch for performance\n    NSLayoutConstraint.activate(constraints)\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n1.  **Forgetting `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false`:** This is the most common mistake, causing `Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints` warnings because your constraints conflict with the system-generated ones.\n2.  **Ambiguous or Conflicting Layouts:** A view must have its position (x, y) and size (width, height) fully defined. Omitting constraints leads to an ambiguous layout. Over-constraining (e.g., fixed width + leading/trailing anchors to a fixed-size superview) causes conflicts.\n3.  **Inefficient Activation:** Activating constraints individually (`constraint.isActive = true`) inside a loop can trigger multiple, expensive layout passes. `NSLayoutConstraint.activate` is optimized to solve them all in one go.\n\n**When to Use:** Programmatic layout is ideal for complex, dynamic UIs, reusable view components, and teams aiming to minimize source control merge conflicts. While Interface Builder is faster for static screens, programmatic layout provides superior flexibility and maintainability in large-scale applications.",

      "front": "Explain the UIViewController lifecycle, focusing on the distinction between view creation (`loadView`), configuration (`viewDidLoad`), and layout (`viewDidLayoutSubviews`). When is it appropriate to override `loadView`, and what is the most critical pitfall?",
      "back": "The UIViewController lifecycle manages the creation, appearance, and destruction of its view. A deep understanding separates view creation, configuration, and layout phases.\n\n**Core Concept Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`loadView()` - Creation:** This method is called when the controller's `view` property is accessed but is currently `nil`. Its sole purpose is to create or load a view and assign it to `self.view`. You override this *only* for a fully programmatic UI. If you use Storyboards or XIBs, you must never override this method.\n\n2.  **`viewDidLoad()` - Configuration:** Called exactly once after the view hierarchy has been loaded into memory (either from your `loadView` or a nib). This is the ideal place for one-time setup: adding subviews, setting up Auto Layout constraints, initializing data sources, and making initial network calls. The view's bounds and frame are not yet finalized here.\n\n3.  **`viewDidLayoutSubviews()` - Layout:** This method is called whenever the view's `layoutSubviews` method is invoked, which happens when the view's bounds change (e.g., device rotation, split-screen changes) and after Auto Layout has calculated final positions. This is the correct and reliable place to perform any frame-based layout calculations, as the geometry is accurate.\n\n**Practical Code Example:**\n```swift\nclass ProgrammaticVC: UIViewController {\n\n    // 1. Override loadView for a fully programmatic UI\n    override func loadView() {\n        // CRITICAL: Do NOT call super.loadView().\n        // Create and assign your root view.\n        self.view = CustomRootView()\n        print(\"1. loadView - View hierarchy created.\")\n    }\n\n    // 2. Configure the view once it's loaded\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad() // Always call super\n        view.backgroundColor = .systemBlue\n        // One-time setup: add targets, configure static properties.\n        // Note: self.view's bounds are not yet final.\n        print(\"2. viewDidLoad - One-time configuration complete.\")\n    }\n\n    // 3. Respond to layout updates\n    override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {\n        super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()\n        // Bounds are now final for the current layout pass.\n        // Perform frame-based layout here if not using Auto Layout.\n        print(\"3. viewDidLayoutSubviews - Bounds are now \\(view.bounds)\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases:**\n\n*   **`loadView` Pitfall:** The most critical mistake is overriding `loadView` and failing to assign a view to `self.view`. This will result in a runtime crash (`NSInternalInconsistencyException`). Also, calling `super.loadView()` inside your override can cause an infinite loop.\n*   **Layout in `viewDidLoad`:** Performing frame-based layout in `viewDidLoad` is a classic error. The view's size is not yet determined by its container, leading to incorrect frames.\n*   **Forgetting `super`:** Failing to call `super` on appearance (`viewWillAppear`, etc.) and layout methods can break behavior inherited from `UIViewController` or its subclasses (e.g., `UINavigationController`).\n\n**When to Use vs. Alternatives:**\n\n*   **`loadView` vs. Storyboard/XIB:** Use `loadView` only when building the entire view hierarchy in code. If you use a Storyboard or XIB, the system handles view loading, and you should begin your setup in `viewDidLoad`.\n*   **`viewDidLoad` vs. `viewWillAppear`:** Use `viewDidLoad` for one-time setup. Use `viewWillAppear` for tasks that must be repeated every time the view becomes visible (e.g., refreshing UI from a model that might have changed).",

      "back": "UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout provides a declarative API to build complex collection view layouts by combining small, reusable components. This is a significant departure from the imperative, calculation-heavy approach of subclassing `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`.\n\n**Core Concept:**\nThe layout is built on a hierarchy:\n1.  **`NSCollectionLayoutSize`**: Defines the size of an element using absolute, estimated, or fractional dimensions. Fractional dimensions (e.g., `fractionalWidth(0.5)`) are key to adaptive layouts, as they are relative to their container.\n2.  **`NSCollectionLayoutItem`**: The smallest unit, representing a single cell. It's configured with a size.\n3.  **`NSCollectionLayoutGroup`**: The main innovation. It's a container that arranges items (or even other groups) horizontally, vertically, or in a custom configuration. This is where you define the spatial relationship between items.\n4.  **`NSCollectionLayoutSection`**: A container for a group. It adds section-specific configurations like orthogonal (horizontal) scrolling, headers/footers (supplementary items), and content insets.\n\nBy composing these elements, you can build sophisticated layouts like the App Store—a section of horizontally scrolling banners, followed by a list, followed by a complex grid—all within a single collection view, often without writing a single coordinate calculation.\n\n**Code Example (App Store-like \"Featured\" section):**\n```swift\n// A layout with one large leading item and two small, stacked trailing items.\nfunc createFeaturedSectionLayout() -> NSCollectionLayoutSection {\n    // Main item taking up 70% of the group's width.\n    let leadingItemSize = NSCollectionLayoutSize(widthDimension: .fractionalWidth(0.7), heightDimension: .fractionalHeight(1.0))\n    let leadingItem = NSCollectionLayoutItem(layoutSize: leadingItemSize)\n    leadingItem.contentInsets = NSDirectionalEdgeInsets(top: 2, leading: 2, bottom: 2, trailing: 2)\n\n    // A group of two vertically stacked items.\n    let trailingItemSize = NSCollectionLayoutSize(widthDimension: .fractionalWidth(1.0), heightDimension: .fractionalHeight(0.5))\n    let trailingItem = NSCollectionLayoutItem(layoutSize: trailingItemSize)\n    trailingItem.contentInsets = NSDirectionalEdgeInsets(top: 2, leading: 2, bottom: 2, trailing: 2)\n    let trailingGroupSize = NSCollectionLayoutSize(widthDimension: .fractionalWidth(0.3), heightDimension: .fractionalHeight(1.0))\n    let trailingGroup = NSCollectionLayoutGroup.vertical(layoutSize: trailingGroupSize, subitem: trailingItem, count: 2)\n\n    // Combine leading item and trailing group into a horizontal group.\n    let containerGroupSize = NSCollectionLayoutSize(widthDimension: .fractionalWidth(0.9), heightDimension: .fractionalHeight(0.4))\n    let containerGroup = NSCollectionLayoutGroup.horizontal(layoutSize: containerGroupSize, subitems: [leadingItem, trailingGroup])\n\n    let section = NSCollectionLayoutSection(group: containerGroup)\n    section.orthogonalScrollingBehavior = .groupPagingCentered\n    return section\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n*   **Fractional Sizing Misunderstanding**: `fractionalHeight(0.5)` inside a horizontal group means 50% of the *group's* height, not the screen's.\n*   **Orthogonal Scrolling Performance**: Sections with orthogonal scrolling load all their cells at once. For very large data sets, this can cause performance issues. Consider using paging or breaking up the data.\n*   **Estimated Dimensions**: Using `.estimated` requires your `UICollectionViewCell` to implement proper self-sizing with Auto Layout. Failure to do so can result in incorrect layouts or performance degradation.\n\n**When to Use vs. Alternatives:**\n*   **Compositional Layout**: The default choice for modern (iOS 13+) apps. Ideal for complex, heterogeneous, or adaptive layouts. Its declarative nature simplifies development and maintenance.\n*   **Flow Layout**: Use for simple, uniform grids or lists, especially when supporting iOS versions before 13. It's lightweight but requires subclassing and manual calculations for anything non-trivial.\n*   **Custom `UICollectionViewLayout`**: The last resort for highly dynamic layouts that cannot be expressed by composing groups, such as tag clouds or circular layouts. It offers maximum power but requires you to manage all layout attributes and invalidation manually.",

      "back": "UIKit and SwiftUI interoperability is crucial for gradual adoption and accessing framework-specific features. It works in two directions:\n\n1.  **SwiftUI in UIKit**: Achieved using `UIHostingController<Content: View>`. This is a standard `UIViewController` subclass that hosts a SwiftUI view. It can be pushed onto a `UINavigationController`, presented modally, or added as a child view controller, seamlessly integrating SwiftUI into a UIKit hierarchy.\n\n2.  **UIKit in SwiftUI**: Achieved via the `UIViewRepresentable` and `UIViewControllerRepresentable` protocols. These require you to implement methods to manage the UIKit component's lifecycle within SwiftUI's declarative structure.\n\n**Coordinator Pattern's Role**\nThe `Coordinator` is a nested class within your representable struct. It acts as a bridge for imperative UIKit patterns like delegates, data sources, and target-action, which don't fit naturally into SwiftUI's declarative state-driven updates. The `makeCoordinator()` method on the representable creates an instance of this class. This coordinator can then be assigned as the delegate for the UIKit component. When a delegate method is triggered, the coordinator can update a SwiftUI `@Binding` or execute a closure to communicate the change back to the SwiftUI view.\n\n```swift\n// Example: Wrapping UIImagePickerController\nstruct ImagePicker: UIViewControllerRepresentable {\n    @Binding var selectedImage: UIImage?\n    @Environment(\\.presentationMode) var presentationMode\n\n    // 1. Create the Coordinator to act as the delegate\n    func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {\n        Coordinator(self)\n    }\n\n    // 2. Create the UIKit view controller instance\n    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> UIImagePickerController {\n        let picker = UIImagePickerController()\n        picker.delegate = context.coordinator // Assign coordinator as delegate\n        return picker\n    }\n\n    // 3. Update the controller (often empty for simple cases)\n    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: UIImagePickerController, context: Context) {}\n\n    // Coordinator class bridges the delegate callbacks\n    class Coordinator: NSObject, UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate {\n        let parent: ImagePicker\n\n        init(_ parent: ImagePicker) {\n            self.parent = parent\n        }\n\n        func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey : Any]) {\n            if let image = info[.originalImage] as? UIImage {\n                parent.selectedImage = image // Update SwiftUI state via binding\n            }\n            parent.presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases**\n\n*   **`update...` Method Frequency**: The `updateUIView` or `updateUIViewController` method can be called frequently for *any* state change in the parent SwiftUI view, not just changes to the properties you pass in. This code must be highly efficient and idempotent. Avoid creating new objects or doing heavy lifting here.\n*   **Lifecycle Mismatch**: SwiftUI's `onAppear` doesn't always map 1:1 with `viewDidLoad`. The `make...` method is called only once for the lifetime of the representable's identity. For complex cleanup, implement `dismantleUIViewController` to deallocate resources when the view is removed from the hierarchy.\n*   **Data Flow**: While `@Binding` is great for simple values, complex state management can become messy. Consider passing a dedicated observable object or using closures for more complex event handling to avoid convoluted bindings.\n*   **Sizing**: SwiftUI's layout system may struggle with a UIKit view's intrinsic content size. You might need to use `.frame()` modifiers in SwiftUI or ensure the underlying `UIView` correctly implements `sizeThatFits(_:)` to prevent layout issues.",

      "back": "I'd explain that `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource` (and its table view equivalent) solves this exact problem by shifting from an imperative to a declarative approach for UI updates. Instead of manually calculating index paths for inserts, deletes, and moves—the source of `NSInternalInconsistencyException`—we simply describe the *final state* of the UI, and the system computes and applies the minimal, safest set of changes.\n\n**Core Concept:**\nThe foundation is the `NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot`. It's a value type that represents the complete state of your UI's data at a single point in time. The process is:\n1. Create a new, empty snapshot.\n2. Populate it with your sections and items in the desired order.\n3. Call `dataSource.apply(snapshot, animatingDifferences: true)`. \nThe data source then performs a diff between the current UI state and your new snapshot, automatically generating the correct calls to insert, delete, move, and reload cells. This completely eliminates the class of bugs related to mismatched data models and UI states.\n\n**Code Example:**\n```swift\n// 1. Define hashable models. Identifier stability is crucial.\nstruct Video: Hashable {\n    let id: UUID\n    var title: String\n}\nenum Section: CaseIterable { case main }\n\n// 2. Setup the data source in viewDidLoad\nvar dataSource: UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<Section, Video>!\n\nfunc configureDataSource() {\n    dataSource = .init(collectionView: collectionView) { collectionView, indexPath, video in\n        let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: \"VideoCell\", for: indexPath)\n        // Configure cell with video data\n        return cell\n    }\n}\n\n// 3. Update the UI by applying a new snapshot\nfunc update(with newVideos: [Video]) {\n    var snapshot = NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot<Section, Video>()\n    snapshot.appendSections([.main])\n    snapshot.appendItems(newVideos)\n\n    // This is thread-safe and calculates the diff automatically.\n    dataSource.apply(snapshot, animatingDifferences: true)\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls & Key Details:**\n*   **Identifier Stability:** The `Hashable` implementation of your item identifiers is critical. If an item's `hashValue` changes (e.g., you hash the `title` which then gets edited), the diffing algorithm will see it as a *delete* and an *insert*, not an *update*. Use a stable, unique ID like a `UUID` or a server-provided database key for the hash.\n*   **Background Updates:** A major advantage is that `dataSource.apply()` is thread-safe. You can build your snapshot on a background queue after a network call and apply it directly, without dispatching to the main queue. The data source handles the main-thread synchronization for UI updates.\n*   **Updating Items:** To update an item's content without moving it, use `snapshot.reconfigureItems([itemToUpdate])` (iOS 15+). This is more efficient than `reloadItems`, which fully dequeues a new cell.",

      "front": "When embedding a SwiftUI view in a UIKit hierarchy using `UIHostingController`, describe the challenges and best practices for managing its lifecycle, data flow, and intrinsic content size.",
      "back": "### Core Concept\n\n`UIHostingController<Content>` is a `UIViewController` subclass that acts as a bridge to embed a SwiftUI view hierarchy within a UIKit application. It manages the SwiftUI view's lifecycle, translating UIKit events like `viewDidLoad` and `viewWillAppear` into SwiftUI's environment, triggering `onAppear`, etc. This allows for incremental adoption of SwiftUI in existing UIKit codebases.\n\n### Data Flow & Lifecycle\n\nThe primary way to communicate data from UIKit to the hosted SwiftUI view is by initializing the view with data or by updating the `rootView` property of the `UIHostingController` instance. Directly mutating the state of the original view instance after it's been passed to the hosting controller is ineffective, as SwiftUI needs a new view body evaluation to be triggered. Re-assigning `rootView` forces this re-evaluation.\n\n```swift\n// 1. SwiftUI View with data dependency\nstruct UserProfileView: View {\n    let username: String\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Text(\"Welcome, \\(username)!\").font(.largeTitle)\n    }\n}\n\n// 2. UIKit ViewController hosting the SwiftUI view\nclass ProfileViewController: UIViewController {\n    private var hostingController: UIHostingController<UserProfileView>?\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        // Initial setup\n        embedSwiftUIView(username: \"InitialUser\")\n        \n        // Simulate an update after 2 seconds\n        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {\n            self.updateUsername(to: \"UpdatedUser\")\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func embedSwiftUIView(username: String) {\n        let profileView = UserProfileView(username: username)\n        let controller = UIHostingController(rootView: profileView)\n        addChild(controller)\n        view.addSubview(controller.view)\n        controller.didMove(toParent: self)\n        \n        // 3. Sizing and layout\n        controller.view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([\n            controller.view.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),\n            controller.view.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor)\n        ])\n        self.hostingController = controller\n    }\n\n    func updateUsername(to newUsername: String) {\n        // 4. Best practice for data update: re-assign rootView\n        hostingController?.rootView = UserProfileView(username: newUsername)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases\n\n1.  **Sizing:** A `UIHostingController`'s view often has an `intrinsicContentSize` of `.zero` or doesn't automatically resize when its SwiftUI content changes. Always use Auto Layout constraints or set an explicit frame. For highly dynamic content, you may need a more complex solution like using SwiftUI's `PreferenceKey` to measure the content size and communicate it back to UIKit via a coordinator or callback.\n2.  **Data Flow Mistakes:** A common error is trying to mutate a `@State` variable inside the SwiftUI view from the UIKit side. This doesn't work. The correct pattern is to treat the SwiftUI view as immutable from UIKit's perspective and provide new data by replacing the `rootView`.\n3.  **Transparent Background:** By default, a `UIHostingController`'s view has a non-transparent background. You must explicitly set `hostingController.view.backgroundColor = .clear` if you want it to blend with the underlying UIKit view hierarchy.\n\n### When to Use vs. Alternatives\n\n*   **Use `UIHostingController`:** When you want to introduce a new feature screen written in SwiftUI into an existing UIKit app, or to replace a complex `UITableViewCell` or component with a declarative SwiftUI view.\n*   **Alternative (`UIViewRepresentable` / `UIViewControllerRepresentable`):** Use these protocols for the opposite direction: embedding a UIKit component (like `MKMapView` or a legacy custom view) into a SwiftUI view hierarchy. Choose the right tool based on which framework is hosting the other.",

      "front": "Describe a scenario where the default Responder Chain is insufficient. How would you customize its path, and what are the potential side effects of overriding a UIResponder's `next` property?",
      "back": "The Responder Chain is a sequence of `UIResponder` objects that forms a dynamic path for events. When an event occurs, it's sent to the first responder (often the view that was touched). If that object can't handle it, it forwards the event to its `next` responder, continuing up the chain until a handler is found or the chain ends.\n\n**Core Concept:** The default chain typically goes from a `UIView` to its superview, up to the `UIViewController`, then its view's superview, and eventually to the `UIWindow`, `UIApplication`, and `UIApplicationDelegate`. This allows for a decoupled event handling mechanism where a child view doesn't need a direct reference to a parent controller to trigger an action.\n\nA scenario where the default chain is insufficient is a custom view component deeply nested in the hierarchy that needs to communicate with a non-ancestor object, like a coordinator or a separate view model. For instance, a reusable `FormInputView` might need to signal a validation event to a `FormCoordinator` that manages the overall form state, bypassing the intermediate view controllers.\n\n**Code Example:**\nHere, we have a `SpecializedView` that wants its `next` responder to be a specific `EventHandler` object, not its superview.\n\n```swift\n// A non-UIResponder class to handle specific actions\nclass EventHandler: NSObject {\n    @objc func handleCustomAction(_ sender: Any) {\n        print(\"EventHandler handled the custom action!\")\n    }\n}\n\nclass SpecializedView: UIView {\n    // We hold a reference to our custom next responder.\n    // This should be weak to prevent retain cycles if the handler also retains this view.\n    weak var customNextResponder: UIResponder?\n\n    override var next: UIResponder? {\n        // If a custom responder is set, return it.\n        // Otherwise, fall back to the default implementation.\n        return customNextResponder ?? super.next\n    }\n}\n\n// In a UIViewController:\nlet eventHandler = EventHandler()\nlet specialView = SpecializedView()\n\n// Inject the custom responder. Now events from specialView will go to eventHandler.\nspecialView.customNextResponder = eventHandler\n\n// When an action with a nil target is sent from specialView or its subviews...\nUIApplication.shared.sendAction(#selector(EventHandler.handleCustomAction), to: nil, from: specialView, for: nil)\n// ...the responder chain will check specialView, then eventHandler.\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases:**\n1.  **Breaking the Chain:** If your override of `next` mistakenly returns `nil`, you sever the chain. This can disable standard behaviors like shake-to-undo, pasteboard actions (copy/paste), and other system-level events that rely on the chain reaching the `UIApplication` object.\n2.  **Retain Cycles:** The `next` property is `unowned(unsafe)`. If you override `next` to return a controller that has a strong reference to your view, you've created a retain cycle that will cause a memory leak. Always ensure the custom responder has a weak reference back to the view, if any.\n3.  **Unexpected Behavior:** Altering the chain can lead to surprising results if another developer (or a system framework) expects the default responder hierarchy.\n\n**When to Use vs. Alternatives:**\n*   **Use Responder Chain Customization:** For creating highly reusable components that need to communicate \"upwards\" in a decoupled way without using delegation, especially when the receiver's identity isn't known at compile time or can change dynamically.\n*   **Alternatives:**\n    *   **Delegation:** Better for a clear, 1-to-1 contract. It's more explicit and type-safe but creates tighter coupling.\n    *   **NotificationCenter:** For broadcasting information (1-to-many). It's fully decoupled but can be hard to debug and lacks a direct response path.\n    *   **Closures:** Excellent for simple, direct callbacks. Can lead to retain cycles if `[weak self]` is forgotten.",

      "back": "These three methods represent critical but distinct stages in a UIViewController's lifecycle, and using them correctly is key to building robust and performant UIs.\n\n**Core Concept Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`viewDidLoad()`**: This method is called only *once* when the controller's view is loaded into memory. At this point, the view hierarchy exists, but the view's bounds and frame are not yet finalized. They are based on the Storyboard or XIB dimensions and do not reflect the actual device screen size. This is the ideal place for one-time setup tasks:\n    *   Adding subviews programmatically.\n    *   Setting up Auto Layout constraints.\n    *   Assigning delegates and data sources.\n    *   Making initial network requests to fetch data for the view.\n\n2.  **`viewWillAppear(_:)`**: This is called just before the view is added to the application's view hierarchy and becomes visible. It's called *every time* the view is about to appear on screen (e.g., when pushed onto a navigation stack, a tab is selected, or it's un-covered by a modal). The view's geometry is still not guaranteed to be final. Use this for tasks that need to happen each time the screen is shown:\n    *   Refreshing UI elements with potentially stale data.\n    *   Updating UI state (e.g., button enabled/disabled).\n    *   Configuring the navigation bar appearance.\n\n3.  **`viewDidLayoutSubviews()`**: This method is called to notify the controller that its view has just laid out its subviews. It is the first point in the lifecycle where the view's `bounds` and `frame` are guaranteed to be correct for the current screen size and orientation. It can be called multiple times during the view's life (e.g., on device rotation, subview changes, or when a scroll view's content size changes). This is the only safe place for:\n    *   Performing frame-dependent calculations.\n    *   Setting a view's `cornerRadius` to create a circle (e.g., `view.layer.cornerRadius = view.bounds.width / 2`).\n    *   Manually adjusting the frames of subviews that don't use Auto Layout.\n\n**Practical Code Example:**\n```swift\nclass ProfileViewController: UIViewController {\n    private let avatarImageView = UIImageView()\n\n    // 1. Called once. View exists, but its frame is not final.\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        // ONE-TIME SETUP: Add subviews, set constraints, initial data fetch.\n        view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground\n        view.addSubview(avatarImageView)\n        // Constraints are the right way to define layout here.\n        // Never set frame based on view.bounds here.\n    }\n\n    // 2. Called every time view is about to appear.\n    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n        super.viewWillAppear(animated)\n        // RECURRING UPDATES: Refresh UI from model state.\n        navigationController?.setNavigationBarHidden(true, animated: animated)\n    }\n\n    // 3. Called after layout pass. Frame and bounds are final.\n    override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {\n        super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()\n        // FRAME-DEPENDENT UI: Use final geometry for layout adjustments.\n        // This is the correct place to make the avatar circular.\n        avatarImageView.layer.cornerRadius = avatarImageView.bounds.width / 2\n        avatarImageView.clipsToBounds = true\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n*   **Incorrect Frame Logic**: Setting a view's `frame` or `layer.cornerRadius` in `viewDidLoad`. This will use incorrect initial bounds and fail on different devices or orientations.\n*   **Redundant Setup**: Placing one-time setup (like `addSubview` or adding gesture recognizers) in `viewWillAppear`, causing it to run unnecessarily multiple times.\n*   **Expensive `viewDidLayoutSubviews`**: Triggering network requests or heavy computations in `viewDidLayoutSubviews`. This method can be called frequently, leading to severe performance issues.",

      "front": "When creating UI programmatically, what is the role of `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints`? Describe the modern Layout Anchor API and how you'd manage dynamic constraint changes.",
      "back": "### Core Concept\nWhen a view is created programmatically, its `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` property defaults to `true`. This tells the system to automatically create constraints based on the view's `frame` and `autoresizingMask`. If you then add your own AutoLayout constraints, you create a conflict between these two systems, leading to the common \"Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints\" runtime error. Setting this property to `false` is the critical first step, signaling that you will define the view's size and position using AutoLayout exclusively.\n\nThe modern approach, `NSLayoutAnchor`, provides a fluent, readable, and type-safe API. It prevents logical errors at compile-time, such as trying to constrain a horizontal anchor (`leadingAnchor`) to a vertical one (`topAnchor`), which was a common pitfall with the older `NSLayoutConstraint` initializer.\n\n### Practical Code Example\n```swift\n// In a UIViewController or UIView subclass\nlet childView = UIView()\n// 1. CRITICAL: Disable autoresizing mask constraints\nchildView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\nchildView.backgroundColor = .systemTeal\nview.addSubview(childView)\n\n// Store a constraint to modify it later\nvar childViewTopConstraint: NSLayoutConstraint!\n\n// 2. Use Layout Anchors and activate constraints efficiently in a batch\nNSLayoutConstraint.activate([\n    childView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),\n    childView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.widthAnchor, multiplier: 0.5),\n    childView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 100)\n])\n\n// For dynamic changes, store the constraint upon creation\nchildViewTopConstraint = childView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor, constant: 20)\nchildViewTopConstraint.isActive = true\n\n// To change the layout later (e.g., in an animation block):\n// NSLayoutConstraint.deactivate([childViewTopConstraint])\n// let newConstraint = childView.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor)\n// NSLayoutConstraint.activate([newConstraint])\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases\n- **Forgetting `... = false`:** The most frequent error for developers new to programmatic UI.\n- **Activating Before Adding to Hierarchy:** Constraints require a common ancestor. Always call `addSubview()` *before* activating constraints between a parent and child.\n- **Performance:** `NSLayoutConstraint.activate([...])` is more performant than setting `isActive = true` on each constraint individually, as it allows the layout engine to process the changes in a single batch.\n- **Ambiguity/Conflict:** Ensure you provide enough constraints to define both position (X, Y) and size (Width, Height) without over-constraining. Use `UILayoutPriority` to create optional or flexible constraints.\n\n### When to Use vs. Alternatives\nProgrammatic AutoLayout is superior for complex, dynamic UIs, reusable view components, and teams prioritizing clean version control (avoiding Storyboard/XIB merge conflicts). For simpler, static screens, Interface Builder can be faster for prototyping. For new apps, SwiftUI is the modern declarative choice, but programmatic UIKit remains essential for maintaining existing codebases and for fine-grained control over UI components and animations.",

      "back": "Diffable data sources fundamentally shift collection view data management from an imperative to a declarative approach, solving the core problem of state synchronization.\n\n### Core Concept\n\nPreviously, with `performBatchUpdates`, developers manually calculated index paths for insertions, deletions, and moves. This process was error-prone, often leading to `NSInternalInconsistencyException` crashes if the pre-update and post-update item counts didn't align with the operations. The UI's state and the model's state could easily diverge.\n\nDiffable data sources introduce two key components:\n1.  **The Data Source (`UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource`):** This object replaces the traditional `UICollectionViewDataSource` protocol. It's initialized with a `cellProvider` closure, which is responsible for dequeuing and configuring cells.\n2.  **The Snapshot (`NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot`):** This is an immutable value type representing the *entire state* of the UI at a given moment. You build a snapshot by adding sections and items, which must conform to `Hashable`.\n\nTo update the UI, you create a new snapshot reflecting the desired state and pass it to the data source's `apply()` method. The system performs a diffing algorithm on a background thread to determine the minimal set of changes (inserts, deletes, moves) needed to get from the current state to the new one. It then safely applies these changes to the collection view, guaranteeing consistency and preventing crashes.\n\n### Practical Code Example\n```swift\n// 1. Define Hashable models for sections and items\nenum Section { case main }\nstruct Video: Hashable {\n    let id: UUID\n    let title: String\n}\n\nclass VideoViewController: UIViewController {\n    var collectionView: UICollectionView!\n    // 2. The data source is a strongly-held property\n    var dataSource: UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<Section, Video>!\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        // ... setup collection view layout ...\n        configureDataSource()\n        updateSnapshot(with: initialVideos)\n    }\n\n    func configureDataSource() {\n        dataSource = UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<Section, Video>(collectionView: collectionView) { \n            (collectionView, indexPath, video) -> UICollectionViewCell? in\n            // Configure and return the cell as usual\n            let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: \"VideoCell\", for: indexPath)\n            // ... set cell.titleLabel.text = video.title ...\n            return cell\n        }\n    }\n\n    func updateSnapshot(with newVideos: [Video]) {\n        // 3. Create a snapshot representing the new state\n        var snapshot = NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot<Section, Video>()\n        snapshot.appendSections([.main])\n        snapshot.appendItems(newVideos, toSection: .main)\n        \n        // 4. Apply the snapshot. The system handles the diffing and animation.\n        dataSource.apply(snapshot, animatingDifferences: true)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases\n*   **`Hashable` Conformance:** The stability of the diffing algorithm depends entirely on a correct `Hashable` implementation. Use a stable, unique identifier (like a `UUID` or server ID) for hashing and equality checks. Hashing based on mutable properties can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n*   **Updating Item Content:** If a property of a model object changes but its `id` (and thus its hash) does not, the diffing algorithm won't detect a change. To force a cell to re-render with the new data, you must use `snapshot.reconfigureItems([updatedItem])` (iOS 15+) or `snapshot.reloadItems([updatedItem])`.\n*   **Background `apply()`:** The `apply()` method is thread-safe and can be called from a background queue. However, the `cellProvider` closure is always executed on the main queue.\n\n### When to Use vs. Alternatives\n*   **Use Diffable Data Source:** It's the modern default for any `UICollectionView` or `UITableView` with dynamic data. It excels when data changes frequently, comes from asynchronous sources, or requires complex animations. It enforces a single source of truth for UI state, which simplifies logic and improves stability.\n*   **Use Traditional `UICollectionViewDataSource`:** Only consider this for supporting iOS versions before 13, or for displaying completely static data where the overhead of creating snapshots is unnecessary.",

      "back": "Implementing a custom interactive transition involves coordinating three key components:\n\n1.  **`UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`**: This protocol acts as a factory. The presenting view controller sets the presented VC's `transitioningDelegate` to an object (often itself) that conforms to this protocol. Its primary job is to provide the system with the animator and interactor objects when the transition begins. For an interactive dismissal, it implements `animationController(forDismissed:)` to return a custom animator and `interactionController(forDismissal:)` to return an interactor instance *only when the dismissal is driven by a gesture*.\n\n2.  **`UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`**: This is the animator object. It performs the actual view manipulations. It must implement two methods:\n    *   `transitionDuration(using:)`: Returns the total duration of the animation.\n    *   `animateTransition(using:)`: This is where the magic happens. You get a `context` object (`UIViewControllerContextTransitioning`) which provides the `containerView`, `from` and `to` view controllers, and their frames. You are responsible for adding/removing views to/from the `containerView` and running the animations. Crucially, you **must** call `context.completeTransition(!context.transitionWasCancelled)` when your animation completes.\n\n3.  **`UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition`**: This is a concrete class conforming to `UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning`. It translates a gesture's progress into animation progress. A gesture recognizer (e.g., `UIPanGestureRecognizer`) on the presented view controller calls `update()`, `finish()`, or `cancel()` on the interactor instance based on the gesture's state (`.changed`, `.ended`, `.cancelled`). This drives the animation provided by the animator object.\n\n**Code Example (Interactive Dismissal):**\n```swift\n// In PresentedViewController, setup gesture and trigger dismissal\nclass PresentedVC: UIViewController {\n    var interactor: UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition?\n\n    @objc func handleGesture(_ recognizer: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {\n        let percent = recognizer.translation(in: view).y / view.bounds.height\n        switch recognizer.state {\n        case .began:\n            interactor = UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition()\n            dismiss(animated: true) // This triggers the delegate methods\n        case .changed:\n            interactor?.update(percent)\n        case .ended, .cancelled:\n            if percent > 0.5 && recognizer.state != .cancelled {\n                interactor?.finish()\n            } else {\n                interactor?.cancel()\n            }\n            interactor = nil\n        default: break\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// In PresentingViewController, which acts as the delegate\nextension PresentingVC: UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate {\n    func animationController(forDismissed dismissed: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {\n        return DismissAnimator()\n    }\n\n    func interactionController(forDismissal animator: UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning) -> UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning? {\n        // Return the interactor ONLY if the gesture has started\n        return (presentedVC as? PresentedVC)?.interactor\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n*   **Freezing UI**: Forgetting to call `context.completeTransition()` in your animator will freeze your application's UI, as the system never considers the transition finished.\n*   **Incorrect View Hierarchy**: Not adding the `toView` to the `containerView` or failing to remove the `fromView` on completion can lead to visual bugs or black screens.\n*   **Ignoring Cancellation**: If a transition is cancelled (e.g., the user aborts the interactive gesture), you must check `context.transitionWasCancelled` and revert all view changes to restore the pre-transition state.\n\n**When to Use:**\nUse custom transitions for unique, brand-defining animations (e.g., card-like modals, circular reveals) that standard system transitions cannot achieve. For simple push/modal presentations, prefer the built-in styles for platform consistency and simplicity. In SwiftUI, `matchedGeometryEffect` and the `.transition()` modifier are the declarative equivalents.",

Its size is defined via `NSCollectionLayoutDimension`, which can be fractional (e.g., 50% of its container's width), absolute, or estimated for self-sizing content.\n- **`NSCollectionLayoutGroup`**: A container that arranges items (or other groups) horizontally, vertically, or in a custom configuration. This is the key to creating rows, columns, and nested structures that were cumbersome with `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`.\n- **`NSCollectionLayoutSection`**: A container for a group that defines the layout for an entire section. It configures properties like orthogonal (perpendicular) scrolling, inter-group spacing, and supplementary views like headers/footers (`boundarySupplementaryItems`).\n\nThis compositional model (item -> group -> section) allows developers to build complex, heterogeneous layouts like the App Store's home page declaratively. `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`, by contrast, is primarily designed for simple, line-based grids, making such advanced layouts require significant custom code and subclassing.\n\n```swift\nfunc createLayout() -> UICollectionViewLayout {\n    // 1.
