      "back": "Clean Architecture, specifically VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router), aims to create testable, maintainable, and scalable iOS apps. It achieves this by dividing the app into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility.\n\n*   **View:** Responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions. It's passive and doesn't contain business logic. It informs the Presenter about user actions.\n*   **Interactor:** Contains the business logic and use cases of the application. It receives requests from the Presenter, performs the necessary operations (e.g., data manipulation, networking), and provides results back to the Presenter. It's independent of UI.\n*   **Presenter:** Acts as a mediator between the View and the Interactor. It receives data from the Interactor, formats it for display in the View, and handles user interactions from the View by sending requests to the Interactor.\n*   **Entity:** Represents the data model of the application. It's a simple data structure that holds the data used by the Interactor.\n*   **Router (Wireframe):** Responsible for navigation and routing between different modules or screens of the application. It encapsulates the UIViewController instantiation and presentation logic.\n\n**Example (simplified):**\n\n```swift\n// Entity\nstruct User {\n    let name: String\n}\n\n// Interactor Protocol\nprotocol UserInteractorInput {\n    func fetchUser()\n}\n\n// Presenter Protocol\nprotocol UserPresenterOutput {\n    func presentUser(user: User)\n}\n\n// Interactor\nclass UserInteractor: UserInteractorInput {\n    var presenter: UserPresenterOutput!\n\n    func fetchUser() {\n        // Fetch user data (e.g., from network or database)\n        let user = User(name: \"John Doe\")\n        presenter.presentUser(user: user)\n    }\n}\n\n// Presenter\nclass UserPresenter: UserPresenterOutput {\n    weak var view: UserView!\n\n    func presentUser(user: User) {\n        view.displayUserName(name: user.name)\n    }\n}\n\n// View (ViewController)\nclass UserView: UIViewController {\n    var presenter: UserPresenter!\n\n    func displayUserName(name: String) {\n        // Update UI with user name\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n\n*   **Over-engineering:** Applying VIPER to small, simple apps can add unnecessary complexity.\n*   **Tight coupling:** Ensure loose coupling between layers by using protocols and dependency injection.\n*   **Massive Presenter:** Avoid putting too much logic in the Presenter; delegate complex operations to helper classes or the Interactor.\n\n**VIPER vs. MVC:**\n\nMVC (Model-View-Controller) often leads to \"Massive View Controllers\" where the controller handles both UI logic and business logic. VIPER addresses this by separating responsibilities more clearly, making code more testable and maintainable.  VIPER's unidirectional data flow also improves predictability and reduces side effects. However, VIPER has a steeper learning curve and requires more boilerplate code than MVC. Use VIPER for complex apps where maintainability and testability are crucial, and MVC for simpler apps where rapid development is more important.  Alternatives include MVVM, which is less strict than VIPER but still improves testability over MVC.",

      "front": "Compare and contrast MVVM, MVC, and VIPER architectures. When would you choose one over the others, and why?",
      "back": "These architectures provide different ways to structure an iOS app, each with its own tradeoffs.\n\n**MVC (Model-View-Controller):**\n*   **Concept:** MVC separates the app into three interconnected parts. Model manages data, View displays data, Controller acts as intermediary.\n*   **Example:** A `UIViewController` fetches data from a `Model`, configures a `UIView` to display it, and updates the `Model` based on user interaction.\n*   **Pitfalls:** Often leads to \"Massive View Controllers\" where controllers handle too much logic, making testing and maintenance difficult.\n*   **When to Use:** Simple apps or prototypes where development speed is crucial and long-term maintainability isn't a primary concern.\n\n**MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):**\n*   **Concept:** Model manages data, View is passive and displays data, ViewModel transforms Model data into a format easily consumed by the View and handles user input.\n*   **Example:** A `ViewModel` fetches data from a `Model`, formats it into strings for display in labels, and exposes commands that the `View` can bind to. The `View` observes changes in the `ViewModel` to update its UI.\n*   **Pitfalls:** Can become complex with many bindings in the View, leading to performance issues or difficulty debugging.  Requires a good understanding of data binding techniques.\n*   **When to Use:** Medium-sized apps where testability and separation of concerns are more important than rapid development.  Suited for apps with complex UI logic.\n    ```swift\n    // Example (simplified)\n    class MyViewModel {\n        @Published var displayName: String = \"\"\n\n        private let user: User\n\n        init(user: User) {\n            self.user = user\n            self.displayName = user.firstName + \" \" + user.lastName\n        }\n    }\n\n    // In the View:\n    // @ObservedObject var viewModel: MyViewModel\n    // Text(viewModel.displayName)\n    ```\n\n**VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router):**\n*   **Concept:** Divides the app into five layers with distinct responsibilities: View displays data, Interactor contains business logic, Presenter prepares data for the View, Entity represents data objects, Router handles navigation.\n*   **Example:**  A `View` informs the `Presenter` of a user action. The `Presenter` tells the `Interactor` to perform a use case. The `Interactor` processes the data and returns results to the `Presenter`. The `Presenter` formats the data and updates the `View`. The `Router` handles transitions between screens.\n*   **Pitfalls:** Significant initial overhead due to the increased number of components. Can feel overly complex for smaller apps.\n*   **When to Use:** Large, complex apps with strict requirements for testability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. Facilitates team collaboration and independent feature development.\n\n**Choosing the Right Architecture:**\n\n*   **Complexity:** MVC is simplest, then MVVM, then VIPER.\n*   **Testability:** VIPER is the most testable, then MVVM, then MVC.\n*   **Maintainability:** VIPER is generally considered most maintainable for large projects, MVVM for medium, MVC for small.\n*   **Development Speed:** MVC is usually fastest to implement initially, but can slow down as the project grows.\n*   **Team Size:** VIPER is beneficial for large teams working on independent features.\n\n**In summary:** MVC is suitable for smaller projects. MVVM is a good balance for medium-sized projects requiring testability. VIPER is best for large, complex applications demanding high testability and maintainability, but comes with increased complexity.",

      "front": "Explain Dependency Injection (DI) and its different patterns (Constructor, Property, Method) in iOS. Discuss benefits, drawbacks, and when to use each.",
      "back": "DI is a design pattern promoting loose coupling by providing dependencies to a component instead of the component creating them. This enhances testability, reusability, and maintainability.\n\n**Core Concept:** The core idea is Inversion of Control (IoC). Instead of a class controlling the creation of its dependencies, control is inverted \u2013 dependencies are supplied from the outside.\n\n**DI Patterns:**\n\n1.  **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are passed through the initializer.  It ensures that the object is always in a valid state with all necessary dependencies. This is the preferred pattern when the dependency is *required* for the object to function correctly.\n\n    ```swift\n    class MyViewController: UIViewController {\n        private let service: DataService\n\n        init(service: DataService) {\n            self.service = service\n            super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n        }\n\n        required init?(coder: NSCoder) {\n            fatalError(\"init(coder:) has not been implemented\")\n        }\n\n        override func viewDidLoad() {\n            super.viewDidLoad()\n            service.fetchData() // Use the injected service\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    *   **Pros:** Dependencies are explicit and visible in the initializer.  Guarantees the object is created with valid dependencies. Promotes immutability if dependencies are `let`.\n    *   **Cons:** Can lead to long initializer lists if there are many dependencies. Requires changes to the initializer if a new dependency is added.\n    *   **Pitfalls:** Forgetting to inject dependencies in the initializer, leading to unexpected `nil` values.\n\n2.  **Property Injection:** Dependencies are set via properties after the object is created. Useful for *optional* dependencies or when using storyboards.\n\n    ```swift\n    class MyViewController: UIViewController {\n        var service: DataService?\n\n        override func viewDidLoad() {\n            super.viewDidLoad()\n            service?.fetchData() // Optional chaining since service might be nil\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Elsewhere:\n    let viewController = MyViewController()\n    viewController.service = MyDataService()\n    ```\n\n    *   **Pros:**  Easy to implement, especially with storyboards.  Allows for optional dependencies with default implementations.\n    *   **Cons:** Dependencies might be `nil` if not set, requiring optional handling.  Hides dependencies compared to constructor injection. Can lead to an invalid state if a required dependency is missing.\n    *   **Pitfalls:**  Force unwrapping optional dependencies without checking for `nil`.\n\n3.  **Method Injection:** Dependencies are passed as arguments to a method. Useful when a dependency is only needed for a specific operation or varies with each call.\n\n    ```swift\n    class MyViewController: UIViewController {\n        func processData(data: String, validator: DataValidator) {\n            if validator.isValid(data) {\n                // Process the data\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Usage:\n    let viewController = MyViewController()\n    let data = \"Some data\"\n    let validator = MyDataValidator()\n    viewController.processData(data: data, validator: validator)\n    ```\n\n    *   **Pros:**  Dependencies are localized to the specific method.  Makes the method more flexible and reusable.\n    *   **Cons:**  Can clutter method signatures if there are many dependencies.  Less common than constructor or property injection.\n    *   **Pitfalls:**  Overusing method injection when constructor or property injection would be more appropriate.\n\n**Benefits of DI:**\n\n*   **Testability:**  Easier to mock or stub dependencies for unit testing.\n*   **Reusability:**  Components are more reusable because they don't rely on specific implementations of their dependencies.\n*   **Maintainability:**  Loose coupling makes the code easier to change and maintain.\n*   **Decoupling:** Reduces dependencies between classes.\n\n**Drawbacks of DI:**\n\n*   **Complexity:**  Can add complexity to the codebase, especially when using DI frameworks.\n*   **Boilerplate:**  Requires writing more code to inject dependencies.\n\n**When to Use vs. Alternatives:**\n\n*   Use DI when you want to improve the testability, reusability, and maintainability of your code.\n*   Alternatives to DI include: Singletons, Service Locators, and direct instantiation. Singletons create tight coupling and are hard to test. Service Locators hide dependencies. Direct instantiation leads to tight coupling.\n\n**Choosing a DI Framework:**\n\nWhile manual DI is common, DI frameworks can simplify the process. When selecting, consider frameworks that minimize code intrusion (avoiding subclassing or protocol conformance).",

      "back": "Modularization breaks down a large project into smaller, independent modules, improving maintainability, testability, and reusability. Strategies include: \n\n1. **Frameworks/Libraries:**  Create separate frameworks or static libraries for distinct features. \n   *Benefits:* Strongest isolation, code reuse across projects. \n   *Drawbacks:* Higher initial setup, increased app size (static libraries). \n   *Example:*  `MyNetworkLayer.framework` handles all networking. \n   ```swift\n   //MyNetworkLayer/MyNetworkLayer.swift\n   public class NetworkManager {\n       public static let shared = NetworkManager()\n       private init() {}\n       public func fetchData(from url: URL, completion: @escaping (Data?) -> Void) {\n           // Network request logic\n       }\n   }\n   //In the App target\n   import MyNetworkLayer\n   NetworkManager.shared.fetchData(from: url) { data in\n       // Handle data\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **CocoaPods/Swift Package Manager (SPM):**  Manage dependencies and create internal modules. \n   *Benefits:* Dependency management, code reuse, easy integration. \n   *Drawbacks:*  Can introduce external dependencies, potential version conflicts. \n   *Example:* SPM packages for UI components, data models, or utility functions.\n   ```swift\n   // Package.swift\n   let package = Package(\n       name: \"MyUtilities\",\n       platforms: [.iOS(.v13)],\n       products: [\n           .library(\n               name: \"MyUtilities\",\n               targets: [\"MyUtilities\"])\n       ],\n       dependencies: [],\n       targets: [\n           .target(\n               name: \"MyUtilities\",\n               dependencies: [])\n       ]\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Target-Based Modularization:**  Create separate targets within the same project for different modules. \n   *Benefits:* Good isolation, shared code within the app. \n   *Drawbacks:*  Can be complex to manage dependencies between targets. \n   *Example:* Separate targets for different app features (e.g., \"LoginModule\", \"ProfileModule\").  Use internal visibility or protocols to limit access between modules.\n   *Pitfalls:* Watch out for circular dependencies between targets. This can cause build errors.\n\n4. **Folder-Based Modularization:** Organize code into folders representing modules. This is the weakest form of modularization.\n   *Benefits:* Simple to implement. \n   *Drawbacks:* Little to no actual isolation, relies on developer discipline. \n   *Example:* Folders like \"Networking\", \"UIComponents\", \"DataModels\".  Use access control (e.g., `internal`, `private`) to limit access within the module.\n   *Pitfalls:* Easy to bypass module boundaries accidentally.\n\n5. **VIPER Architecture:**  (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router).  Organizes code into layers with defined responsibilities, forming modules around use cases. \n   *Benefits:* Excellent testability, separation of concerns, highly maintainable. \n   *Drawbacks:*  Increased complexity, significant boilerplate code. \n   *Example:* A \"User Authentication\" module might have separate VIPER components. \n\n**Choosing a Strategy:**\n*   **Small Projects:** Folder-based or target-based modularization may suffice.\n*   **Medium Projects:** CocoaPods/SPM or target-based modularization.\n*   **Large Projects:** Frameworks/libraries, VIPER with SPM, or a combination.\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n*   Ignoring module boundaries.\n*   Creating circular dependencies.\n*   Over-modularizing (too many small modules).\n*   Not using access control properly.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n*   Monolithic architecture (no modularization) - suitable for very small projects.\n\nPrioritize clear interfaces between modules and thorough testing to ensure maintainability and prevent regressions.",

      "back": "Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP) is a design paradigm in Swift that emphasizes defining behavior and capabilities through protocols rather than rigid class inheritance hierarchies. Unlike traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where functionality is inherited from a superclass (an 'is-a' relationship), POP allows types (including structs and enums) to adopt behaviors by conforming to protocols (a 'can-do' relationship).\n\nThis approach leads to a more flexible and decoupled architecture. By defining contracts between components using protocols, we can easily swap out implementations, which is invaluable for unit testing (using mock objects) and adapting to changing requirements. Protocol extensions further enhance this by providing default implementations, reducing code duplication without forcing a base class.\n\n**Practical Code Example: Reusable UI State Logic**\n\nA common challenge is managing loading/error states across different `UIViewController`s. Instead of creating a `BaseViewController` (a classic OOP approach), we can define a protocol.\n\n```swift\n// 1. Define the capability with a protocol\nprotocol LoadableView {\n    var activityIndicator: UIActivityIndicatorView { get }\n    func showLoading()\n    func hideLoading()\n    func showError(_ message: String)\n}\n\n// 2. Provide a default implementation for any UIViewController that conforms\nextension LoadableView where Self: UIViewController {\n    func showLoading() {\n        // Assumes activityIndicator is added to the view hierarchy\n        activityIndicator.startAnimating()\n        self.view.isUserInteractionEnabled = false\n    }\n\n    func hideLoading() {\n        activityIndicator.stopAnimating()\n        self.view.isUserInteractionEnabled = true\n    }\n    \n    func showError(_ message: String) {\n        // A simple alert for demonstration\n        let alert = UIAlertController(title: \"Error\", message: message, preferredStyle: .alert)\n        alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: \"OK\", style: .default))\n        present(alert, animated: true)\n    }\n}\n\n// 3. A view controller can now easily adopt this behavior\nclass UserProfileViewController: UIViewController, LoadableView {\n    // Conformance requires providing the activityIndicator property\n    let activityIndicator = UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .large)\n    \n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        // Setup for indicator\n        activityIndicator.center = view.center\n        view.addSubview(activityIndicator)\n    }\n    \n    func fetchUserProfile() {\n        showLoading() // Directly use the functionality from the protocol extension\n        // ... network call\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n*   **Protocol Bloating:** Creating monolithic protocols that violate the Interface Segregation Principle. Prefer smaller, more focused protocols.\n*   **Overusing PATs (Protocols with Associated Types):** While powerful, they add complexity and can't be used as concrete types in collections without type erasure (e.g., using `any` keyword in Swift 5.7+ or a manual wrapper).\n*   **Ambiguous Default Implementations:** If multiple protocol extensions provide a default implementation for the same method, it can lead to unexpected behavior. Be explicit when needed.\n\n**When to Use vs. Alternatives:**\n*   **Favor POP for:** Defining architectural boundaries (e.g., VIPER's View-Presenter contract), sharing functionality across unrelated types (including value types), and enabling robust mocking for tests.\n*   **Consider Class Inheritance for:** Strong 'is-a' relationships where you need to inherit stored properties and a significant amount of implementation logic (e.g., a `UITableViewController` is fundamentally a `UIViewController`). Swift's design encourages favoring composition via POP over inheritance in most architectural scenarios.",

The primary goal is to improve build times, enforce ownership, and scale development.\n\n**Core Concepts: Module Boundary Strategies**\n\n1.  **By Feature:** Each user-facing feature (e.g., `Profile`, `Search`, `Checkout`) becomes a distinct module. This is the most common approach as it aligns with product teams, promotes feature ownership, and allows for independent development and deployment of features.\n\n2.  **By Layer:** Code is grouped by its architectural responsibility (e.g., `Networking`, `UIComponents`, `Analytics`, `CoreData`). These foundational modules are then consumed by feature modules. This strategy promotes reusability and a clean dependency graph where high-level features depend on low-level core services, but not vice-versa.\n\n3.  **Hybrid Approach:** The most pragmatic strategy combines both. You create foundational layer-based modules (`SharedUI`, `Core`) and then build feature-based modules (`ProductDetails`, `ShoppingCart`) on top of them.\n\n**Inter-Module Communication**\n\nModules must be decoupled. Communication shouldn't rely on direct class references. Common patterns include:\n*   **Coordinator Pattern:** A parent coordinator manages the lifecycle and routing between child coordinators, each belonging to a module.\n*   **Delegate/Protocol Pattern:** A module defines a delegate protocol for its output. The presenting module conforms to this protocol to receive events, inverting the dependency.\n*   **Dependency Injection:** A module's public interface exposes an initializer or factory method that accepts all its dependencies (including delegates or closures) from the outside.\n\n```swift\n// In the presenting module (e.g., AppCoordinator)\nprotocol SettingsModuleDelegate: AnyObject {\n    func settingsModuleDidRequestLogout()\n}\n\nclass AppCoordinator: SettingsModuleDelegate {\n    func showSettings() {\n        // The SettingsModule exposes a factory `build` method.\n        // We inject the delegate to handle communication back.\n        let settingsVC = SettingsModule.build(delegate: self)\n        navigationController.pushViewController(settingsVC, animated: true)\n    }\n\n    func settingsModuleDidRequestLogout() {\n        // Handle app-wide logout logic here\n        print(\"Logout requested from SettingsModule\")\n    }\n}\n\n// In the `SettingsModule` Swift Package\n// Public interface for the module\npublic final class SettingsModule {\n    public static func build(delegate: SettingsModuleDelegate?) -> UIViewController {\n        let presenter = SettingsPresenter(delegate: delegate)\n        let viewController = SettingsViewController(presenter: presenter)\n        // ... wire up interactor, etc.\n        return viewController\n    }\n}\n\n// Internal presenter within SettingsModule\nfinal class SettingsPresenter {\n    private weak var delegate: SettingsModuleDelegate?\n    \n    init(delegate: SettingsModuleDelegate?) {\n        self.delegate = delegate\n    }\n    \n    func logoutButtonTapped() {\n        // After internal logic, communicate out via delegate\n        delegate?.settingsModuleDidRequestLogout()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls**\n\n*   **Circular Dependencies:** Module A depending on B and B on A. Resolve this by extracting the shared code into a new, lower-level module.\n*   **The \"Core\" Dumping Ground:** A `Core` or `Common` module becomes a mini-monolith. Be disciplined about what belongs there; it should only contain truly shared, stable code.\n*   **Over-modularization:** Creating too many tiny modules increases the cognitive and maintenance overhead. Start with larger feature modules and break them down only when necessary.\n\n**When to Use vs. Alternatives**\n\nModularization is essential for large-scale applications with multiple teams to reduce build times and manage complexity. For smaller projects, a well-structured monolith using clear folder separation (e.g., grouping by feature) can suffice. The overhead of managing Swift Packages or Pods is unnecessary until you feel the pain of a monolithic structure, such as slow builds, frequent merge conflicts, and tangled dependencies.",

      "front": "How does Clean Architecture's Dependency Rule specifically address the Massive View Controller problem in iOS, and what are the primary trade-offs of enforcing this rule?",
      "back": "Clean Architecture's core principle is the Dependency Rule: source code dependencies must only point inwards, from lower-level details to higher-level policies. In iOS, this directly combats the Massive View Controller (MVC) problem by systematically dismantling the responsibilities that are typically crammed into a `UIViewController`.\n\nIn a standard MVC, the Controller handles user input, manipulates the model, and updates the view, often including business logic, data formatting, and navigation. Clean Architecture, often implemented in iOS as VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router), enforces a strict separation of these concerns into distinct layers. The `UIViewController` is relegated to the outermost layer (Frameworks & Drivers), becoming a passive `View` component. Its only job is to display what the `Presenter` tells it and forward user events.\n\n- **Business Logic** moves to the `Interactor` (Use Cases layer).\n- **Data Formatting/Presentation Logic** moves to the `Presenter` (Interface Adapters layer).\n- **Navigation Logic** moves to the `Router` (or Wireframe).\n\nThe Dependency Rule is enforced through abstractions (protocols). The `Interactor` (inner layer) defines an output protocol that the `Presenter` (outer layer) conforms to. The `Interactor` never has a direct reference to a concrete `Presenter`, thus inverting the dependency and making business logic completely independent of the UI.\n\n**Code Example (VIPER-like structure):**\n```swift\n// Interactor Layer (Use Cases) - No UIKit imports!\nprotocol UserProfileInteractorOutput: AnyObject {\n    func didFetch(user: User)\n    func didFailToFetchUser(error: Error)\n}\n\nclass UserProfileInteractor {\n    weak var presenter: UserProfileInteractorOutput?\n    private let userService: UserServiceProtocol // Dependency\n\n    // ... init ...\n\n    func fetchUserProfile(id: String) {\n        userService.fetchUser(with: id) { [weak self] result in\n            switch result {\n            case .success(let user):\n                self?.presenter?.didFetch(user: user)\n            case .failure(let error):\n                self?.presenter?.didFailToFetchUser(error: error)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Presenter Layer (Interface Adapters)\nclass UserProfilePresenter: UserProfileInteractorOutput {\n    weak var view: UserProfileViewProtocol? // View is an abstraction\n\n    // Conformance to Interactor's output protocol\n    func didFetch(user: User) {\n        let fullName = \"\\(user.firstName) \\(user.lastName)\"\n        let viewModel = UserProfileViewModel(fullName: fullName)\n        view?.display(viewModel: viewModel)\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Primary Trade-offs:**\n1.  **High Boilerplate:** The most significant drawback. Creating multiple files (View, Interactor, Presenter, Router, Entity, protocols) for a single screen introduces a lot of ceremonial code, slowing down initial development.\n2.  **Increased Complexity:** The cognitive overhead of navigating between many small, interconnected components can be high, especially for developers new to the pattern.\n3.  **Potential for Over-engineering:** For simple applications or prototypes, the strict separation is often unnecessary and counterproductive. It shines in large, complex, long-lived projects with multiple teams where testability and maintainability are paramount.\n\n**When to use vs. Alternatives:** Use Clean Architecture/VIPER for mission-critical, large-scale apps where business logic is complex and must be rigorously tested in isolation. For most medium-sized apps, MVVM offers a better balance by separating presentation logic into a ViewModel without the full ceremony of an Interactor and Router.",

      "back": "The choice of architecture is a critical decision based on trade-offs between project scale, team size, and long-term maintainability. There's no single best answer; the context dictates the optimal choice.\n\n**MVC (Model-View-Controller)**\n- **Concept**: Apple's default pattern. The Controller mediates between the Model (data) and the View (UI). However, in practice, the View and Controller are tightly coupled (`UIViewController`), leading to the 'Massive View Controller' problem where the controller handles UI logic, data transformation, and navigation, making it difficult to test and maintain.\n- **When to Use**: Best for small projects, prototypes, or simple screens where the overhead of more complex patterns is unnecessary. It's fast to set up but scales poorly.\n\n**MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**\n- **Concept**: Introduces a ViewModel between the View/Controller and the Model. The ViewModel prepares data for the View, handles presentation logic, and exposes state via data binding (e.g., using Combine or closures). The View Controller's role is reduced to observing the ViewModel and updating the UI.\n- **When to Use**: The industry standard for most medium-to-large apps. It significantly improves testability by isolating logic in the ViewModel (a plain Swift object) and slims down the View Controller. It strikes a great balance between separation of concerns and manageable complexity.\n\n**VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router)**\n- **Concept**: A strict application of the Single Responsibility Principle. Each component has one job: View (displays UI), Interactor (business logic), Presenter (presentation logic), Entity (model objects), and Router (navigation). Communication happens via protocols.\n- **When to Use**: For very large, complex applications with long lifespans and large teams. The high initial setup cost and boilerplate are justified by extreme testability, modularity, and the ability for developers to work on separate components in parallel without conflict. It's often overkill for smaller projects.\n\n**Code Snippet (Conceptual Login Flow)**\n```swift\n// MVC: Controller has all the logic\nclass LoginViewController: UIViewController {\n    func loginButtonTapped() {\n        // 1. Validate input\n        // 2. Make network call\n        // 3. Handle response\n        // 4. Navigate to next screen\n    }\n}\n\n// MVVM: Controller delegates to ViewModel\nclass LoginViewController: UIViewController {\n    let viewModel: LoginViewModel\n    func loginButtonTapped() {\n        viewModel.login(user: \"...\", pass: \"...\")\n    }\n    // Binds to viewModel properties to update UI\n}\n\n// VIPER: View only reports events to Presenter\nprotocol LoginViewOutput: AnyObject { func loginButtonTapped() }\n\nclass LoginViewController: UIViewController {\n    var presenter: LoginViewOutput?\n    func loginButtonTapped() {\n        presenter?.loginButtonTapped() // Responsibility is passed on\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pitfalls & Edge Cases**\n- **MVC**: Leads to Massive View Controllers, tight coupling, and poor testability.\n- **MVVM**: Can lead to a 'Massive ViewModel' if not managed well. Logic for navigation can be ambiguous\u2014some put it in the VC, others use a Coordinator pattern alongside MVVM.\n- **VIPER**: Over-engineering is a major risk. The high number of files and protocols can drastically slow down development for simple features and create a steep learning curve for new team members.",

      "front": "Compare and contrast Constructor, Property, and Method Injection in Swift. When would you choose one over the others, and what are the implications for testability and encapsulation?",
      "back": "Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that inverts control, allowing dependencies to be 'injected' into an object from an external source rather than created internally. This decouples components, making them more modular, reusable, and testable.\n\n### Core Concepts & Comparison\n\n1.  **Constructor (Initializer) Injection**: Dependencies are provided through the object's initializer. This is the most robust and explicit form of DI.\n    *   **Pros**: Guarantees that an object is fully configured with its required dependencies upon creation. Dependencies can be stored in immutable properties (`let`), enhancing thread safety and predictability.\n    *   **Cons**: Can lead to initializer bloat if an object has too many dependencies, often indicating a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.\n\n2.  **Property Injection**: Dependencies are set via a public `var` property after the object has been initialized.\n    *   **Pros**: Useful for optional dependencies or when the DI framework is managed by the system (e.g., UIKit with Storyboards and `@IBOutlet`). It can also be used to break retain cycles by marking the property `weak`.\n    *   **Cons**: The dependency can be changed at any time, and there's no compile-time guarantee it will be set before use, potentially leading to runtime crashes. This creates 'temporal coupling'\u2014the order of operations matters.\n\n3.  **Method Injection**: The dependency is passed as a parameter to a specific method that requires it. \n    *   **Pros**: Ideal for dependencies that are only needed for a single operation or vary with each call (e.g., injecting the current `Date` or a specific data model).\n    *   **Cons**: Can make method signatures verbose if the same dependency is needed by many methods. It's not suitable for dependencies that are fundamental to the object's state.\n\n### Code Example\n\n```swift\n// Abstraction for a dependency\nprotocol NetworkFetching { func fetchData() -> String }\n\n// 1. Constructor Injection (Most common & recommended)\nclass ViewModelA {\n    private let networkService: NetworkFetching // Immutable, required dependency\n\n    init(networkService: NetworkFetching) {\n        self.networkService = networkService\n    }\n\n    func load() { print(networkService.fetchData()) }\n}\n\n// 2. Property Injection (For optional dependencies or UIKit integration)\nclass ViewControllerB: UIViewController {\n    var networkService: NetworkFetching? // Optional, mutable dependency\n\n    func viewDidAppear() {\n        // Must handle the optional case\n        print(networkService?.fetchData() ?? \"Service not available\")\n    }\n}\n\n// 3. Method Injection (For transient, call-specific dependencies)\nclass DataProcessorC {\n    // The dependency is scoped only to this method call\n    func processData(using networkService: NetworkFetching) {\n        let data = networkService.fetchData()\n        // ... process data\n        print(\"Processed: \\(data)\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Pitfalls & When to Use\n\n*   **Choose Constructor Injection** for mandatory dependencies. It makes the object's requirements explicit and ensures it's always in a valid state.\n*   **Choose Property Injection** for optional dependencies, to resolve circular dependencies (`weak var`), or when you don't control object instantiation (e.g., `UIViewController` from a Storyboard). Be wary of the risk of the property being `nil` during use.\n*   **Choose Method Injection** when the dependency is not a core part of the object's state but a tool for a specific task. This avoids burdening the object with a property it rarely uses.\n\nAvoid the **Service Locator** anti-pattern, where an object actively requests dependencies from a global locator. This hides dependencies, making the code harder to reason about and test in isolation, which is the opposite goal of DI.",
