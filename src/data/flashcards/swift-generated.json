      "back": "Variadic generics (future) allow functions to accept a variable number of type parameters, removing limits like SwiftUI's old 10-view restriction.  Type erasure hides the underlying type, often to abstract concrete implementations behind protocols. Example:  `AnyView` erases the specific `View` type. This allows views with different types to be used interchangeably.  Using `any Protocol` indicates an existential type, implying dynamic dispatch and potential performance impact compared to generics using static dispatch.  Variadic generics improve this further, but this is still a work in progress in Swift. ",

The `$` prefix accesses the projected value via `projectedValue`.  Example: `@MyWrapper var x: Int` creates `_x` for storage, `x` for wrapped access, `$x` for projected access.  Swift 5.1+",
