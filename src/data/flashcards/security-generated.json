Benefits include enhanced privacy and data integrity.  \n\nTo disable ATS selectively (e.g., for specific domains during development or testing), use `NSExceptionDomains` in the `Info.plist`. Be cautious and provide justification; consider using temporary exceptions and re-enabling ATS in production builds.  Since iOS 10 you need to specify `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent` to allow non secure connections on web views.",

Flexible, but requires manual management.\n*   **Property List Encryption**: Encrypt Plist Files using `NSDataWritingOptions`. Easy, but less secure than other methods\n\nTradeoffs: Security vs. Performance, complexity of implementation, and granularity of encryption.",

      "back": "The OWASP Mobile Security Project provides resources for developing and maintaining secure mobile apps. Key risks include: \n\n*   **Insecure Data Storage:** Sensitive data stored unencrypted. Mitigate by using the Keychain, encrypting Core Data, and avoiding storing sensitive data locally.\n*   **Insufficient Cryptography:** Weak or improperly implemented encryption. Use strong, modern crypto libraries like CryptoKit (Swift 5.1+), TLS 1.3, and avoid custom crypto.\n*   **Insecure Authentication/Authorization:** Weak or bypassed authentication. Implement multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, and proper session management.\n*   **Client-Side Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in web views or other client-side components. Sanitize inputs and use secure coding practices.\n*   **Reverse Engineering:** Code can be decompiled. Use code obfuscation techniques, runtime integrity checks, and protect sensitive logic.\n*   **Transport Layer Protection:** Data transmitted insecurely. Enforce TLS for all network communication, use certificate pinning, and validate server certificates.\n*   **Platform API misuse:** Improper use of Apple's APIs. Follow security best practices, and stay up to date with API changes.\n\nRegular security audits, penetration testing, and adhering to secure coding practices are crucial.",
