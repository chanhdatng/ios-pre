      "back": "Clean Architecture, specifically VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router), aims to create testable, maintainable, and scalable iOS apps. It achieves this by dividing the app into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility.\n\n*   **View:** Responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions. It's passive and doesn't contain business logic. It informs the Presenter about user actions.\n*   **Interactor:** Contains the business logic and use cases of the application. It receives requests from the Presenter, performs the necessary operations (e.g., data manipulation, networking), and provides results back to the Presenter. It's independent of UI.\n*   **Presenter:** Acts as a mediator between the View and the Interactor. It receives data from the Interactor, formats it for display in the View, and handles user interactions from the View by sending requests to the Interactor.\n*   **Entity:** Represents the data model of the application. It's a simple data structure that holds the data used by the Interactor.\n*   **Router (Wireframe):** Responsible for navigation and routing between different modules or screens of the application. It encapsulates the UIViewController instantiation and presentation logic.\n\n**Example (simplified):**\n\n```swift\n// Entity\nstruct User {\n    let name: String\n}\n\n// Interactor Protocol\nprotocol UserInteractorInput {\n    func fetchUser()\n}\n\n// Presenter Protocol\nprotocol UserPresenterOutput {\n    func presentUser(user: User)\n}\n\n// Interactor\nclass UserInteractor: UserInteractorInput {\n    var presenter: UserPresenterOutput!\n\n    func fetchUser() {\n        // Fetch user data (e.g., from network or database)\n        let user = User(name: \"John Doe\")\n        presenter.presentUser(user: user)\n    }\n}\n\n// Presenter\nclass UserPresenter: UserPresenterOutput {\n    weak var view: UserView!\n\n    func presentUser(user: User) {\n        view.displayUserName(name: user.name)\n    }\n}\n\n// View (ViewController)\nclass UserView: UIViewController {\n    var presenter: UserPresenter!\n\n    func displayUserName(name: String) {\n        // Update UI with user name\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n\n*   **Over-engineering:** Applying VIPER to small, simple apps can add unnecessary complexity.\n*   **Tight coupling:** Ensure loose coupling between layers by using protocols and dependency injection.\n*   **Massive Presenter:** Avoid putting too much logic in the Presenter; delegate complex operations to helper classes or the Interactor.\n\n**VIPER vs. MVC:**\n\nMVC (Model-View-Controller) often leads to \"Massive View Controllers\" where the controller handles both UI logic and business logic. VIPER addresses this by separating responsibilities more clearly, making code more testable and maintainable.  VIPER's unidirectional data flow also improves predictability and reduces side effects. However, VIPER has a steeper learning curve and requires more boilerplate code than MVC. Use VIPER for complex apps where maintainability and testability are crucial, and MVC for simpler apps where rapid development is more important.  Alternatives include MVVM, which is less strict than VIPER but still improves testability over MVC.",

      "front": "Compare and contrast MVVM, MVC, and VIPER architectures. When would you choose one over the others, and why?",
      "back": "These architectures provide different ways to structure an iOS app, each with its own tradeoffs.\n\n**MVC (Model-View-Controller):**\n*   **Concept:** MVC separates the app into three interconnected parts. Model manages data, View displays data, Controller acts as intermediary.\n*   **Example:** A `UIViewController` fetches data from a `Model`, configures a `UIView` to display it, and updates the `Model` based on user interaction.\n*   **Pitfalls:** Often leads to \"Massive View Controllers\" where controllers handle too much logic, making testing and maintenance difficult.\n*   **When to Use:** Simple apps or prototypes where development speed is crucial and long-term maintainability isn't a primary concern.\n\n**MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):**\n*   **Concept:** Model manages data, View is passive and displays data, ViewModel transforms Model data into a format easily consumed by the View and handles user input.\n*   **Example:** A `ViewModel` fetches data from a `Model`, formats it into strings for display in labels, and exposes commands that the `View` can bind to. The `View` observes changes in the `ViewModel` to update its UI.\n*   **Pitfalls:** Can become complex with many bindings in the View, leading to performance issues or difficulty debugging.  Requires a good understanding of data binding techniques.\n*   **When to Use:** Medium-sized apps where testability and separation of concerns are more important than rapid development.  Suited for apps with complex UI logic.\n    ```swift\n    // Example (simplified)\n    class MyViewModel {\n        @Published var displayName: String = \"\"\n\n        private let user: User\n\n        init(user: User) {\n            self.user = user\n            self.displayName = user.firstName + \" \" + user.lastName\n        }\n    }\n\n    // In the View:\n    // @ObservedObject var viewModel: MyViewModel\n    // Text(viewModel.displayName)\n    ```\n\n**VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router):**\n*   **Concept:** Divides the app into five layers with distinct responsibilities: View displays data, Interactor contains business logic, Presenter prepares data for the View, Entity represents data objects, Router handles navigation.\n*   **Example:**  A `View` informs the `Presenter` of a user action. The `Presenter` tells the `Interactor` to perform a use case. The `Interactor` processes the data and returns results to the `Presenter`. The `Presenter` formats the data and updates the `View`. The `Router` handles transitions between screens.\n*   **Pitfalls:** Significant initial overhead due to the increased number of components. Can feel overly complex for smaller apps.\n*   **When to Use:** Large, complex apps with strict requirements for testability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. Facilitates team collaboration and independent feature development.\n\n**Choosing the Right Architecture:**\n\n*   **Complexity:** MVC is simplest, then MVVM, then VIPER.\n*   **Testability:** VIPER is the most testable, then MVVM, then MVC.\n*   **Maintainability:** VIPER is generally considered most maintainable for large projects, MVVM for medium, MVC for small.\n*   **Development Speed:** MVC is usually fastest to implement initially, but can slow down as the project grows.\n*   **Team Size:** VIPER is beneficial for large teams working on independent features.\n\n**In summary:** MVC is suitable for smaller projects. MVVM is a good balance for medium-sized projects requiring testability. VIPER is best for large, complex applications demanding high testability and maintainability, but comes with increased complexity.",

      "back": "VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) is a Clean Architecture approach for iOS. It divides an app into distinct layers of responsibility, promoting testability and maintainability. It tackles the 'Massive View Controller' issue by distributing responsibilities.\n\n*   **View:** Displays data and informs the Presenter about user actions. It's passive and doesn't contain business logic.\n*   **Interactor:** Contains the business logic and use cases of the app. It retrieves data from Entities and performs operations based on user actions received from the Presenter.\n*   **Presenter:** Acts as a mediator between the View and the Interactor. It formats data from the Interactor for display in the View and handles user input by calling Interactor methods. It doesn't contain UI logic.\n*   **Entity:** Represents the data model of the app. It's a simple data object.\n*   **Router:** Handles navigation between different modules or screens.\n\nExample (simplified):\n```swift\n// Entity\nstruct User {\n    let name: String\n}\n\n// Interactor\nclass UserInteractor {\n    func fetchUser(completion: (User?) -> Void) {\n        // Simulate fetching user data\n        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {\n            completion(User(name: \"John Doe\"))\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Presenter\nclass UserPresenter {\n    weak var view: UserViewInterface?\n    let interactor: UserInteractor\n\n    init(interactor: UserInteractor) {\n        self.interactor = interactor\n    }\n\n    func viewDidLoad() {\n        interactor.fetchUser { [weak self] user in\n            guard let user = user else { return }\n            self?.view?.displayUserName(name: user.name)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// View Interface\nprotocol UserViewInterface: AnyObject {\n    func displayUserName(name: String)\n}\n\n// View (ViewController)\nclass UserViewController: UIViewController, UserViewInterface {\n    @IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel!\n    var presenter: UserPresenter!\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        presenter.viewDidLoad()\n    }\n\n    func displayUserName(name: String) {\n        nameLabel.text = name\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Advantages:**\n*   Improved testability due to separation of concerns.\n*   Increased code reusability.\n*   Better maintainability and scalability.\n*   Clear separation of responsibilities leads to cleaner code.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n*   Increased complexity and boilerplate code, especially for simple apps.\n*   Steeper learning curve.\n*   Can be overkill for smaller projects.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n*   Over-engineering: Applying VIPER to simple apps where MVC would suffice.\n*   Tight coupling between components: Ensure components communicate through interfaces.\n*   Putting UI logic in the Presenter: The Presenter should format data, not manipulate UI elements directly.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n*   MVC (Model-View-Controller): Simpler architecture suitable for smaller projects.\n*   MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Another popular architecture that separates the View from the Model using a ViewModel.\n*   Coordinator Pattern: Focuses on navigation and flow control.\n*   The Composable Architecture (TCA): A modern architecture framework that provides a more streamlined and type-safe approach to building complex applications by combining state management, composition, and effects into a single cohesive system.\n\nWhen to use VIPER: VIPER is best suited for large, complex applications where maintainability, testability, and scalability are critical.

      "front": "Explain Dependency Injection (DI) and its different patterns (Constructor, Property, Method) in iOS. Discuss benefits, drawbacks, and when to use each.",
      "back": "DI is a design pattern promoting loose coupling by providing dependencies to a component instead of the component creating them. This enhances testability, reusability, and maintainability.\n\n**Core Concept:** The core idea is Inversion of Control (IoC). Instead of a class controlling the creation of its dependencies, control is inverted – dependencies are supplied from the outside.\n\n**DI Patterns:**\n\n1.  **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are passed through the initializer.  It ensures that the object is always in a valid state with all necessary dependencies. This is the preferred pattern when the dependency is *required* for the object to function correctly.\n\n    ```swift\n    class MyViewController: UIViewController {\n        private let service: DataService\n\n        init(service: DataService) {\n            self.service = service\n            super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n        }\n\n        required init?(coder: NSCoder) {\n            fatalError(\"init(coder:) has not been implemented\")\n        }\n\n        override func viewDidLoad() {\n            super.viewDidLoad()\n            service.fetchData() // Use the injected service\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    *   **Pros:** Dependencies are explicit and visible in the initializer.  Guarantees the object is created with valid dependencies. Promotes immutability if dependencies are `let`.\n    *   **Cons:** Can lead to long initializer lists if there are many dependencies. Requires changes to the initializer if a new dependency is added.\n    *   **Pitfalls:** Forgetting to inject dependencies in the initializer, leading to unexpected `nil` values.\n\n2.  **Property Injection:** Dependencies are set via properties after the object is created. Useful for *optional* dependencies or when using storyboards.\n\n    ```swift\n    class MyViewController: UIViewController {\n        var service: DataService?\n\n        override func viewDidLoad() {\n            super.viewDidLoad()\n            service?.fetchData() // Optional chaining since service might be nil\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Elsewhere:\n    let viewController = MyViewController()\n    viewController.service = MyDataService()\n    ```\n\n    *   **Pros:**  Easy to implement, especially with storyboards.  Allows for optional dependencies with default implementations.\n    *   **Cons:** Dependencies might be `nil` if not set, requiring optional handling.  Hides dependencies compared to constructor injection. Can lead to an invalid state if a required dependency is missing.\n    *   **Pitfalls:**  Force unwrapping optional dependencies without checking for `nil`.\n\n3.  **Method Injection:** Dependencies are passed as arguments to a method. Useful when a dependency is only needed for a specific operation or varies with each call.\n\n    ```swift\n    class MyViewController: UIViewController {\n        func processData(data: String, validator: DataValidator) {\n            if validator.isValid(data) {\n                // Process the data\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Usage:\n    let viewController = MyViewController()\n    let data = \"Some data\"\n    let validator = MyDataValidator()\n    viewController.processData(data: data, validator: validator)\n    ```\n\n    *   **Pros:**  Dependencies are localized to the specific method.  Makes the method more flexible and reusable.\n    *   **Cons:**  Can clutter method signatures if there are many dependencies.  Less common than constructor or property injection.\n    *   **Pitfalls:**  Overusing method injection when constructor or property injection would be more appropriate.\n\n**Benefits of DI:**\n\n*   **Testability:**  Easier to mock or stub dependencies for unit testing.\n*   **Reusability:**  Components are more reusable because they don't rely on specific implementations of their dependencies.\n*   **Maintainability:**  Loose coupling makes the code easier to change and maintain.\n*   **Decoupling:** Reduces dependencies between classes.\n\n**Drawbacks of DI:**\n\n*   **Complexity:**  Can add complexity to the codebase, especially when using DI frameworks.\n*   **Boilerplate:**  Requires writing more code to inject dependencies.\n\n**When to Use vs. Alternatives:**\n\n*   Use DI when you want to improve the testability, reusability, and maintainability of your code.\n*   Alternatives to DI include: Singletons, Service Locators, and direct instantiation. Singletons create tight coupling and are hard to test. Service Locators hide dependencies. Direct instantiation leads to tight coupling.\n\n**Choosing a DI Framework:**\n\nWhile manual DI is common, DI frameworks can simplify the process. When selecting, consider frameworks that minimize code intrusion (avoiding subclassing or protocol conformance).",

      "front": "Discuss different modularization strategies in iOS development, focusing on their benefits, drawbacks, and when to choose one over another. Include practical examples.",
      "back": "Modularization breaks down a large project into smaller, independent modules, improving maintainability, testability, and reusability. Strategies include: \n\n1. **Frameworks/Libraries:**  Create separate frameworks or static libraries for distinct features. \n   *Benefits:* Strongest isolation, code reuse across projects. \n   *Drawbacks:* Higher initial setup, increased app size (static libraries). \n   *Example:*  `MyNetworkLayer.framework` handles all networking. \n   ```swift\n   //MyNetworkLayer/MyNetworkLayer.swift\n   public class NetworkManager {\n       public static let shared = NetworkManager()\n       private init() {}\n       public func fetchData(from url: URL, completion: @escaping (Data?) -> Void) {\n           // Network request logic\n       }\n   }\n   //In the App target\n   import MyNetworkLayer\n   NetworkManager.shared.fetchData(from: url) { data in\n       // Handle data\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **CocoaPods/Swift Package Manager (SPM):**  Manage dependencies and create internal modules. \n   *Benefits:* Dependency management, code reuse, easy integration. \n   *Drawbacks:*  Can introduce external dependencies, potential version conflicts. \n   *Example:* SPM packages for UI components, data models, or utility functions.\n   ```swift\n   // Package.swift\n   let package = Package(\n       name: \"MyUtilities\",\n       platforms: [.iOS(.v13)],\n       products: [\n           .library(\n               name: \"MyUtilities\",\n               targets: [\"MyUtilities\"])\n       ],\n       dependencies: [],\n       targets: [\n           .target(\n               name: \"MyUtilities\",\n               dependencies: [])\n       ]\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Target-Based Modularization:**  Create separate targets within the same project for different modules. \n   *Benefits:* Good isolation, shared code within the app. \n   *Drawbacks:*  Can be complex to manage dependencies between targets. \n   *Example:* Separate targets for different app features (e.g., \"LoginModule\", \"ProfileModule\").  Use internal visibility or protocols to limit access between modules.\n   *Pitfalls:* Watch out for circular dependencies between targets. This can cause build errors.\n\n4. **Folder-Based Modularization:** Organize code into folders representing modules. This is the weakest form of modularization.\n   *Benefits:* Simple to implement. \n   *Drawbacks:* Little to no actual isolation, relies on developer discipline. \n   *Example:* Folders like \"Networking\", \"UIComponents\", \"DataModels\".  Use access control (e.g., `internal`, `private`) to limit access within the module.\n   *Pitfalls:* Easy to bypass module boundaries accidentally.\n\n5. **VIPER Architecture:**  (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router).  Organizes code into layers with defined responsibilities, forming modules around use cases. \n   *Benefits:* Excellent testability, separation of concerns, highly maintainable. \n   *Drawbacks:*  Increased complexity, significant boilerplate code. \n   *Example:* A \"User Authentication\" module might have separate VIPER components. \n\n**Choosing a Strategy:**\n*   **Small Projects:** Folder-based or target-based modularization may suffice.\n*   **Medium Projects:** CocoaPods/SPM or target-based modularization.\n*   **Large Projects:** Frameworks/libraries, VIPER with SPM, or a combination.\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n*   Ignoring module boundaries.\n*   Creating circular dependencies.\n*   Over-modularizing (too many small modules).\n*   Not using access control properly.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n*   Monolithic architecture (no modularization) - suitable for very small projects.\n\nPrioritize clear interfaces between modules and thorough testing to ensure maintainability and prevent regressions.",
